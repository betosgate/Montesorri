This specificity is the gift of sensorial training. Walk slowly — much more slowly than you might naturally. Pausing to listen with eyes closed for a full minute is a meditation practice that develops both sensory acuity and mindfulness. The nature journal entry documents this refined perception permanently. Compare it to early-year nature observations to see the tremendous growth in vocabulary and detail.",

The water glass activity is a wonderful substitute if you do not have Montessori bells — fill glasses with varying amounts of water and strike with a metal spoon. The child should be able to order 5-7 pitches from low to high. Instrument identification by sound demonstrates sophisticated auditory processing. The composition activity is magical: the child arranges sounds deliberately, making aesthetic choices. This is artistic expression through the auditory sense. Simple notation (drawing circles at different heights) can represent the melody visually.",
