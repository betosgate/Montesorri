    "parent_notes": "Illustration is not just decoration — it is a form of visual literacy. Notice how the child's illustrations have evolved from early-year scribbles or disconnected shapes to images that tell a story and match the text. This is the integration of multiple skills: comprehension (understanding what to draw), fine motor (controlling the drawing tools), and artistic expression (choosing colors, adding detail). Do not rush this process. Some children may need extra time — illustration is deeply absorbing work. If the child wants to add more text after seeing their illustrations, encourage it! The interaction between words and images is how picture books work, and the child is learning this firsthand.",

This is not rote memorization — it is deep structural understanding. Many elementary teachers are astounded when Montessori children arrive already understanding squares and skip counting. During the demonstration, let the child work at their own pace. If they stumble on a count, give them time — the beads are self-correcting.

The color grading exercises the child has practiced all year were not just about matching tablets; they were training the eye to perceive subtlety.

If using colored pencils, pressing lighter creates paler tones. The resulting artwork is often strikingly beautiful and demonstrates a skill that many adults struggle with. This is concrete evidence that the sensorial work 'worked' — the child sees the world with greater nuance.",

Fractions are notoriously difficult in conventional education but Montessori children learn them concretely with the fraction insets: they can SEE that two fourths fills the same space as one half. When your child demonstrates equivalencies, they are doing work that many older children struggle with. This is the power of concrete, sensorial mathematics. Let them take their time with each demonstration — mathematical fluency shows in confident, unhurried work.",
