Both are valid. The 'About the Author' page on the back is a fun touch that models what real books have. Display the book prominently. Read it to family members.

The whisper-shout game for multiples of 3 is especially effective because the child must hold two patterns in mind simultaneously: the counting sequence and which numbers are multiples. Pattern fill-in worksheets reinforce recognition of the sequences. The bead chain 'race' (competing against yourself, not others) builds speed and accuracy. By the end of this lesson, the child has practiced six different skip counting sequences — a remarkable mathematical foundation. These sequences directly map to multiplication tables: skip counting by 3s IS the 3 times table. The child is building multiplication fluency without flashcards or rote memorization, which is the Montessori way.",
