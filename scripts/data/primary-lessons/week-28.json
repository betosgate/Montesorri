Do not intervene unless safety is a concern.\n5. Note which works the child chooses, how long they concentrate, and how they handle transitions between works.\n6.

If the child finishes quickly, they may be ready for longer work periods. If they struggle to choose, the shelves may need refreshing with new or more challenging works. Maria Montessori called this self-directed activity 'normalization' — the natural state of the child engaged in purposeful work.",
