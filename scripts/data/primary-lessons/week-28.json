In Montessori education, community helpers are not just about jobs — they are about how individuals contribute to the greater good. Scientists improve medicine, protect the environment, and expand human knowledge. When the child draws themselves as a scientist, they are building identity: 'I can be a scientist.' This is especially important for children from underrepresented groups in STEM. Avoid gendered stereotypes — show diverse scientists. If your child is passionate about a particular area of science, research that type of scientist together.",
