The child reads and follows each step independently.\n5. Parent observes and assists only with safety concerns (sharp knives).\n6. The child serves the fruit salad to the family.\n7.

The physical action of touching each bone while singing creates kinesthetic memory. The key anatomical insight is that the skeleton is a SYSTEM — all bones are connected and work together. If one bone is injured, it affects the entire system. This systems thinking is a cornerstone of Montessori education and prepares the child for understanding other systems: ecosystems, solar systems, number systems. Sing this song at bedtime, in the car, and at the dinner table — repetition is how songs (and facts) become permanent.",
