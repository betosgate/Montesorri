Simply acknowledge this: 'Both c and k can say /k/. You will learn the rules for when to use each one as you read more.' This honest approach prevents frustration later.",

    "parent_notes": "Cultural celebrations are central to Montessori's peace education. Holi is ideal because it is visually spectacular and celebrates universal themes: the arrival of spring, the triumph of good over evil, and the joy of community. The story of Holika and Prahlad can be simplified for young children: a boy believed in goodness, and even when tested by fire, goodness protected him. The art activity is a sensorial experience of color mixing and texture. If possible, show a short video of actual Holi celebrations — the joy is contagious. This lesson builds empathy and cultural literacy: 'People around the world celebrate in different, beautiful ways.'",

    "parent_notes": "Swimmy is a masterpiece of children's literature that addresses individuality, resilience, and cooperation. The story's message — that being different is an asset, not a liability — resonates deeply with Montessori philosophy, which respects each child's unique developmental path. Leo Lionni's illustrations use stamping and watercolor techniques that children can experiment with. The climactic solution (fish swimming in formation) introduces the concept of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. This book can open rich conversations about times the child has felt different and how being different can be a strength.",
