    "instructions": "1. Cut vegetables in half to reveal cross-sections: bell pepper, celery bunch, mushroom, potato (cut a shape into it), corn cob.\n2. Dip the flat cut side into tempera paint.\n3. Press onto paper and lift — reveal the print!\n4. 'Look at the star inside the pepper! The circles inside the celery!'\n5. Create a vegetable print composition.\n6. Label which vegetable made each print.",

The cross-sections reveal patterns the child has never noticed: the star inside a pepper, the fractal pattern in broccoli, the circles in celery. This connects to botany and develops observational skills. Use vegetables that are past their prime — this is a great way to use up produce that's too old for eating.",
