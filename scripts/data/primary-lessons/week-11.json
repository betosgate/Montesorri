    "parent_notes": "Plant care is one of the most meaningful Montessori practical life activities because it involves genuine responsibility for a living thing. The child sees direct consequences: water the plant and it thrives; neglect it and it wilts. This cause-and-effect relationship teaches accountability more powerfully than any lecture. Designate plant care as the child's daily morning job. Put the watering can in an accessible spot. Spider plants, pothos, and succulents are forgiving choices for beginners. If a plant does wilt from overwatering or underwatering, use it as a learning moment rather than a failure. Maria Montessori placed plants throughout the classroom specifically because caring for them develops the child's sense of responsibility and connection to nature.",

The Montessori approach presents phonograms on green-bordered cards, distinct from the pink single-sound cards. Keep both phonogram cards accessible so the child can review. The words 'much,' 'such,' and 'rich' show that phonograms can appear at the end of words too, expanding the child's decoding ability significantly.",

This requires control and patience. Scatter only a small amount at first so the child can see success.

This allows the child to focus purely on the process: combine quantities by category, count each category, and compose the answer. The physical act of putting beads together makes addition concrete — the child sees addition as 'gathering' rather than an abstract operation. Use two trays to represent the two numbers, then pour/move them together on a central mat. Next week will introduce addition WITH exchange, where a category sums to 10 or more and must be converted. But this first experience should be clean and successful.",

    "parent_notes": "This lesson addresses a common misconception — that Africa is one homogeneous place. By contrasting two very different African cultures (Maasai pastoral life vs. ancient Egyptian civilization), the child begins to appreciate the continent's extraordinary diversity. Be careful to present both cultures with respect and accuracy. The Maasai are not 'primitive' — they are a contemporary people with a rich, intentional way of life. Ancient Egypt is not the only African civilization, but it is the most familiar starting point for young children. The hieroglyphic writing activity is highly motivating and connects language arts to cultural studies. If the child is fascinated, explore further with books or documentaries about either culture.",

Gerald McDermott's retelling features bold, geometric art inspired by Ashanti textile designs. The story teaches that everyone has unique gifts, and cooperation achieves what no individual can alone — a perfect Montessori message. The concept of a pourquoi (French for 'why') story — a tale that explains natural phenomena — is a wonderful literary concept for young children. After this book, the child may enjoy other Anansi tales or pourquoi stories from different cultures. Connect to this week's Africa cultural studies.",
