Good scent choices: lemon, cinnamon, vanilla extract, peppermint, coffee grounds, lavender. Make two of each. The wafting technique (fanning scent toward the nose rather than sniffing directly) is important — it is gentler and mirrors what scientists do in laboratories. Build vocabulary: 'Is this scent sharp or soft? Sweet or spicy? Strong or gentle?' This material develops concentration, discrimination, and the language to describe sensory experiences.",

    "parent_notes": "This book is a delightful introduction to cause and effect (if/then thinking) and circular narrative structure. Children find the mouse's escalating demands hilarious, which makes it highly engaging. The circular ending is a sophisticated literary concept that even young children can grasp concretely: the story starts and ends in the same place. After reading, you can play a 'chain game' at home: 'If I give you a crayon, what would you want next? And then what?' This extends the cause-and-effect thinking. Laura Numeroff wrote many 'If You Give...' books — if your child loves this one, the series provides wonderful repeated exposure to the same narrative structure.",
