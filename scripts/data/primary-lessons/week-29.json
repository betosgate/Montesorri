Mention to your child: 'Smell is the only sense directly connected to your memory center. That is why smells can bring back strong memories!'

At this age, keep durations simple: 30 minutes, 1 hour, 15 minutes. If the child notices that the same activities happen at the same times each day, that is a discovery about routine and rhythm — both important Montessori concepts. You can laminate this schedule and use it daily, which reinforces both time-telling and the child's sense of autonomy.",
