    "instructions": "1. 'Today we are doing real woodworking! We will take a rough piece of wood and make it smooth and beautiful.'\n2. Present the wooden piece. Let the child feel the rough surface.\n3. Demonstrate sanding: hold the sandpaper flat, move WITH the grain (show the grain lines), use even pressure.\n4. 'Start with the coarser sandpaper (80 grit) to remove the rough spots. Then switch to finer sandpaper (150 grit) to make it silky.'\n5. Child sands the entire piece. Check by feeling: 'Is it smooth everywhere? Run your hand over it. Any rough spots left?'\n6. Wipe off sawdust with a damp cloth.\n7. Choose paint or stain color. Demonstrate painting with even strokes, going in one direction.\n8. Child paints the piece. Allow to dry.\n9. Optional: apply a second coat after drying.\n10. Clean brushes thoroughly. Wipe down the workspace.",

In traditional Montessori classrooms, woodworking is a valued activity that develops concentration, fine motor strength, and an appreciation for craftsmanship. Sanding is meditative and calming — many children find deep focus in the repetitive motion. Teaching the child to sand with the grain introduces the concept of respecting the material. The finished product makes an excellent gift, reinforcing the Montessori value of creating for others. Safety note: ensure the wood piece has no splinters or sharp edges before presenting it to the child.",

This is called fact families, and understanding this relationship dramatically reduces the number of facts to memorize. The strip board makes this visible: the same strips that show 3+7=10 also show 10-7=3 when used on the subtraction board.

Understanding that addition and subtraction are inverse operations reduces the number of facts to memorize by 75% — knowing 3+5=8 gives you three other facts for free. The triangular card is a powerful visual tool: covering one number and asking 'what is missing?' generates both addition and subtraction facts. This concept also introduces the commutative property of addition (the order does not matter) and sets the stage for algebraic thinking (if 3+?=8, then ?=8-3). Use the counters extensively — the concrete experience of combining and separating is essential.",

    "instructions": "1. 'Before GPS and maps on phones, how did people find their way? They used nature!'\n2. Navigation by stars: 'Sailors looked at the North Star to know which direction was north. It never moves!'\n3. Navigation by sun: 'The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. If you know that, you can find your direction anytime!'\n4. Navigation by landmarks: 'People memorized mountains, rivers, and special trees to find their way home.'\n5. The compass invention: 'About 1,000 years ago in China, people discovered that a magnetized needle always points north! They invented the COMPASS.'\n6. Show a compass. Let the child hold it and walk around, watching the needle.\n7. 'Polynesian navigators sailed thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean using only stars, waves, and birds!'\n8. Go outside: determine north using the compass. Find east, south, west.\n9. Play a direction game: 'Walk 5 steps north. Turn east. Walk 3 steps. Where are you?'",

Navigation is a universal human challenge, and every culture developed solutions. The Polynesian navigators are particularly impressive — they crossed the Pacific Ocean using star paths, wave patterns, bird behavior, and cloud formations, with no instruments at all. This challenges the common assumption that modern technology is superior in every way. Using a compass outside is thrilling for children — the idea that a tiny needle always knows where north is seems like magic. The direction game reinforces spatial vocabulary and cardinal directions in a fun, physical way.",
