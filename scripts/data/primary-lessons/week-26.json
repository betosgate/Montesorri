Let the child feel the rough surface.\n3. Demonstrate sanding: hold the sandpaper flat, move WITH the grain (show the grain lines), use even pressure.\n4. 'Start with the coarser sandpaper (80 grit) to remove the rough spots. Then switch to finer sandpaper (150 grit) to make it silky.'\n5. Child sands the entire piece. Check by feeling: 'Is it smooth everywhere? Run your hand over it. Any rough spots left?'\n6. Wipe off sawdust with a damp cloth.\n7. Choose paint or stain color. Demonstrate painting with even strokes, going in one direction.\n8. Child paints the piece. Allow to dry.\n9. Optional: apply a second coat after drying.\n10. Clean brushes thoroughly.

Choose poems with strong rhythm and imagery — funny poems work wonderfully for first memorization. Shel Silverstein and Jack Prelutsky are often favorites. Do not test or quiz — let memorization happen through joyful repetition. Reciting to family members, stuffed animals, or the mirror builds confidence and public speaking skills.

If possible, the treasure hunt extension is a wonderful, memorable way to end the week — the child uses all their new skills (compass directions, reading symbols, following a legend) in a real, physical way. If Follow That Map is not available, any adventure book that involves maps will work. The cumulative message of this week is powerful: maps are tools that humans have created and refined over thousands of years, and the child now has the skills to both make and read them. Celebrate this accomplishment!",
