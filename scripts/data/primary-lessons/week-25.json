Demonstrate peeling carrots and potatoes with a child-safe peeler.\n5. Child peels remaining vegetables.\n6. Demonstrate dicing: cut peeled vegetable in half, then into strips, then into small cubes.\n7. Child chops celery, carrots, and potatoes into small pieces (adult handles onion if child is sensitive).\n8. Heat olive oil in a pot (adult manages the stove). Child adds vegetables.\n9. Add water or broth to cover the vegetables.\n10. Season with a pinch of salt and herbs (thyme, bay leaf).\n11. Simmer for 20-25 minutes (use a timer — child sets it).\n12. While soup simmers, clean up all prep dishes and wipe counters.\n13. Taste, adjust seasoning, serve in bowls.\n14. Child serves soup to family members.",

    "description": "If the child shows readiness, this lesson introduces cursive letter formation beginning with pre-writing strokes: waves, loops, and connected curves. The child practices on a chalkboard before transitioning to paper, following the Montessori progression of large to small movement.",
    "instructions": "1. 'You have been writing in print letters beautifully. Some writers also learn CURSIVE — a flowing, connected style of writing. Would you like to try?'\n2. Demonstrate on the chalkboard: draw continuous wave patterns.\n3. Child practices waves: smooth, even, filling the board.\n4. Demonstrate loops: up-loop, down-loop, repeating.\n5. Child practices loops across the board.\n6. Connect them: waves that turn into loops.\n7. Show one simple cursive letter: lowercase 'c' (same as print but with an entry stroke).\n8. Child practices 'c' on the chalkboard, large.\n9. Transfer to paper: practice waves, loops, and 'c' on lined paper with a pencil.\n10. 'Cursive is like dancing with your pencil!'",

In our homeschool context, we have taught print first (which is also a valid approach) and are now introducing cursive as the child shows readiness. Signs of readiness: strong pencil grip, legible print writing, good fine motor control. Start on the chalkboard — large arm movements are easier than small hand movements, and chalk provides natural resistance. There is no rush; some children take to cursive quickly while others need more time. The sandpaper letters (if available) provide the same tactile learning as for print letters. Never force cursive if the child is not interested — revisit later.",
