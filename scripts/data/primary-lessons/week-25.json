    "description": "The child follows a multi-step recipe to prepare vegetable soup, including washing, peeling, chopping, and simmering. This culminating cooking project integrates all previously learned food preparation skills into a single, satisfying meal.",
    "instructions": "1. Review the recipe together: vegetable soup with carrots, celery, potatoes, and onion.\n2. Wash hands thoroughly.\n3. Wash all vegetables under running water.\n4. Demonstrate peeling carrots and potatoes with a child-safe peeler.\n5. Child peels remaining vegetables.\n6. Demonstrate dicing: cut peeled vegetable in half, then into strips, then into small cubes.\n7. Child chops celery, carrots, and potatoes into small pieces (adult handles onion if child is sensitive).\n8. Heat olive oil in a pot (adult manages the stove). Child adds vegetables.\n9. Add water or broth to cover the vegetables.\n10. Season with a pinch of salt and herbs (thyme, bay leaf).\n11. Simmer for 20-25 minutes (use a timer — child sets it).\n12. While soup simmers, clean up all prep dishes and wipe counters.\n13. Taste, adjust seasoning, serve in bowls.\n14. Child serves soup to family members.",

Start on the chalkboard — large arm movements are easier than small hand movements, and chalk provides natural resistance.
