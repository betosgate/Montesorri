Take everything off one shelf at a time. Sort items into three groups: keep here, move to a different shelf, or put away for summer.\n3. Wipe each shelf with a damp cloth, then dry it.\n4. Return items to the shelf, grouping like with like. Place most-used items at the child's eye level.\n5. Move to the next shelf and repeat.\n6. Step back and admire the organized space.\n7.

Resist the urge to direct — let the child make decisions about where things go. You may gently ask, 'Does that grouping make sense to you?' but honor their reasoning. This is also a wonderful opportunity to observe which materials the child gravitates toward and which have been outgrown.",

Real-world connections: sharing snacks, dealing cards, dividing into teams. You might ask: 'If there are 7 cookies and 2 people, what happens to the remainder cookie?' This can lead to delightful discussions about fairness (split it in half — which is a fraction!).",
