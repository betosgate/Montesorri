    "parent_notes": "In Montessori mixed-age classrooms, older children regularly teach younger ones — it is one of the most powerful aspects of the method. Teaching requires the child to organize their knowledge, sequence steps, adjust their communication for the audience, and exercise patience. If you have a younger sibling available, this is ideal. If not, the parent can play the role of a beginner (make genuine mistakes for the child to correct), or the child can teach a stuffed animal or doll. Watch the child teach without intervening — their teaching style will reveal what they have internalized about how lessons are given. You may be amazed at how naturally they adopt your teaching mannerisms!",
