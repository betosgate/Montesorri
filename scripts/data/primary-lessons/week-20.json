Keep division problems simple at first: sharing 12, 15, or 20 among 2, 3, or 4 groups. The child should see that everyone gets the same amount — that's what 'equally' means.

If the child writes 'the green frawg swimd,' celebrate the content and the blend words used. Conventional spelling develops through reading exposure, not correction. Wide-ruled paper helps with letter size. If the child's hand tires, alternate between moveable alphabet and pencil writing — both are valid forms of composition.",
