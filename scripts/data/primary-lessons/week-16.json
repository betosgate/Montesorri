Do not rush to symbols — let the child experience many rounds of building, combining, and counting.

It moves the child from the concrete golden beads (where 10 is physically 10 beads on a bar) to a more abstract representation (where 10 is a single stamp marked '10'). This is one step closer to pencil-and-paper arithmetic. The color coding is essential: it matches the Montessori color hierarchy (green=units, blue=tens, red=hundreds, green=thousands) which the child already knows from numeral cards. Children who have worked extensively with golden beads typically transition to the stamp game smoothly because the operations are identical — only the material has changed. Let the child compare: lay a golden ten bar next to a blue 10 stamp.",

The black lines guide the child at first, but the real learning happens when they can construct without the guide — recognizing which pairs go together by shape and size. Grading the rectangles from wide to narrow is a sensorial exercise in proportion. Some children enjoy tracing the completed rectangles on paper.",

The child may read slowly, letter by letter — this is normal and correct. Do NOT rush them or finish words for them. The struggle of sounding out IS the learning. If they get stuck, point to the letters and ask, 'What sound does this make?' After reading, celebrate genuinely. Many children want to read their first book over and over — encourage this! Rereading builds fluency and confidence. This is a milestone worth marking — consider a small certificate or letting the child call a grandparent to read aloud over the phone.",

Some children ask about exceptions — whales are mammals despite living in water, platypuses are mammals that lay eggs. Welcome these questions as signs of critical thinking! A simple chant helps memory: 'Fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals — five classes, five classes!' This work connects to the Great Lessons in later Montessori years (the Coming of Life).",

Always start subtracting from units (right to left). If the child forgets to exchange, they will discover they do not have enough stamps — this self-correcting aspect is built into the material. Do not explain the algorithm abstractly; let the hands teach the brain.

After practicing, arrange for the child to make a real call to a grandparent or friend — the transfer from practice to real life is thrilling for the child. Taking a message also involves writing practice: who called, what they said, their number. This is a practical, real-world reason to write.",
