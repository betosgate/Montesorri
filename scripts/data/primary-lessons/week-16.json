Thread should be about 18 inches — longer tangles easily. The running stitch is the same one learned on sewing cards, so the child has confidence. In Montessori, sewing develops concentration, fine motor control, patience, and a sense of accomplishment. Display finished work proudly.",

The color coding is essential: it matches the Montessori color hierarchy (green=units, blue=tens, red=hundreds, green=thousands) which the child already knows from numeral cards. Children who have worked extensively with golden beads typically transition to the stamp game smoothly because the operations are identical — only the material has changed.

The black lines guide the child at first, but the real learning happens when they can construct without the guide — recognizing which pairs go together by shape and size. Grading the rectangles from wide to narrow is a sensorial exercise in proportion. Some children enjoy tracing the completed rectangles on paper.",

If the child struggles, go back to golden beads for that problem and then retry with stamps. The key transition is understanding that one stamp can represent a quantity.

The review should feel like a celebration of what they have learned, not a test. If the child hesitates on a phonogram, simply remind them and move on — it will solidify with more exposure. The sentence-building activity is powerful because the child becomes an AUTHOR: they choose the words, construct the meaning, and read their creation. This is writing in its truest sense, even though the child is using moveable alphabet rather than pencil. Save any sentences the child builds — photograph them or transcribe them into a special book.",

Always start subtracting from units (right to left). If the child forgets to exchange, they will discover they do not have enough stamps — this self-correcting aspect is built into the material. Do not explain the algorithm abstractly; let the hands teach the brain. After many repetitions with the stamp game, the child will eventually be ready for pencil-and-paper subtraction and will already understand what 'borrowing' means.",
