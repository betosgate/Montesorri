    "parent_notes": "Grandfather's Journey is a deeply moving book that introduces children to the immigrant experience with tenderness and beauty. Allen Say's luminous watercolors capture both the grandeur of the American landscape and the quiet beauty of Japan. This book naturally connects to the Asia puzzle map work and geography studies. It also opens conversations about cultural identity, belonging, and what it means to call a place 'home.' In Montessori, we cultivate global citizens who respect and appreciate all cultures. This book models that respect beautifully. Children of immigrant families may find this story especially resonant.",

The pentatonic scale is not exclusive to Asian music (it appears in Celtic, African, and Native American music too), but it is a prominent feature of many Asian traditions. Playing recordings of real instruments (koto, erhu, gamelan, sitar) rather than synthesized sounds is important for authentic cultural exposure. YouTube has many high-quality performances of these instruments.",

    "parent_notes": "This classic beginner reader works beautifully as both a read-aloud and as a book the child can begin reading independently. The repeated phrase 'Are you my mother?' gives emerging readers a text they can decode with confidence. The story also addresses a deep emotional need — the security of knowing that a parent will always return. For the child in this lesson, the book serves multiple purposes: reading practice (predictable text), sequencing (remembering the order of characters), and emotional literacy (empathy for the baby bird's feelings). If the child is ready, they may want to read portions of this book themselves.",
