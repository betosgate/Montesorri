Demonstrate the full place setting: plate in the center, fork on the left, knife and spoon on the right, napkin under the fork or on the plate, glass above the knife.\n3. 'The fork is on the LEFT — same side as your left hand. The knife and spoon are on the RIGHT.'\n4. Use a placemat or drawn template as a guide.\n5. The child sets each place independently, checking against the template.\n6. Add a centerpiece: flowers in a vase or a candle.\n7. 'Step back and admire — your table looks lovely! Your guests will feel so special.'",

This work connects to the hundred board, the golden beads (100 = a hundred square), and skip counting. Backward counting (100, 90, 80...) is preparation for subtraction and builds number sense.

Playing recordings of real instruments (koto, erhu, gamelan, sitar) rather than synthesized sounds is important for authentic cultural exposure.

    "parent_notes": "This classic beginner reader works beautifully as both a read-aloud and as a book the child can begin reading independently. The repeated phrase 'Are you my mother?' gives emerging readers a text they can decode with confidence. The story also addresses a deep emotional need — the security of knowing that a parent will always return. For the child in this lesson, the book serves multiple purposes: reading practice (predictable text), sequencing (remembering the order of characters), and emotional literacy (empathy for the baby bird's feelings). If the child is ready, they may want to read portions of this book themselves.",
