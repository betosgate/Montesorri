Keep your other hand clear of the nail once you start hammering. Always hammer on the work surface.'\n3. Demonstrate: hold the nail near the top, tap it gently to set it in the wood.\n4. Once the nail stands on its own, move fingers away. Hammer with firm, controlled taps.\n5. 'Your turn! Set the nail first with light taps. Then hammer it in.'\n6.

Children are capable of using real tools with proper instruction and supervision. Large-headed roofing nails are safest because the child is less likely to miss. Soft wood (balsa, pine, or thick cork) requires less force. Always clamp the wood to a stable surface — the child needs both hands free. Safety goggles are non-negotiable. Start with just hammering nails straight in; later lessons will add sanding, drilling, and simple construction. The concentration and hand-eye coordination required rival any fine motor exercise. Many children find the rhythmic hammering deeply satisfying. This work gives real competence with real tools — a core Montessori principle.",

The child is not expected to memorize grammar rules — they learn through physical manipulation (placing symbols) and pattern recognition. Articles are taught before adjectives because the child already knows 'the' and 'a' as puzzle words. This simply gives those familiar words a grammatical identity.

If the child finds this challenging, go back to a simpler problem (like 111 x 3 = 333, no exchange needed) and build complexity gradually.

This is counterintuitive (4 is bigger than 2, but 1/4 is smaller than 1/2) and needs many concrete experiences to internalize.

If sanding indoors, work over a tray to catch dust and wipe with a damp cloth frequently.

The child works through spatial reasoning, visual discrimination, and fine motor precision.

The greeting practice (opening the door, welcoming the guest, showing them to their seat) is role-played first with stuffed animals or family members. Make this a regular responsibility — the child sets the table for dinner each night. This gives them a meaningful contribution to family life, which builds belonging and self-worth.
