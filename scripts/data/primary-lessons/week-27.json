Gather work samples from the past 9 weeks: art projects, writing samples, math work, drawings, charts, maps.\n3. Spread everything out on a large surface.\n4. 'Look at all of this! You have grown so much. Let us find your BEST pieces for your portfolio.'\n5. Go through each subject area: 'Which writing piece are you most proud of? Which art project?'\n6. Child selects 8-10 pieces that represent their best work or greatest growth.\n7. For each selected piece, child dictates or writes: what it is, when they made it, and why they chose it.\n8. Organize the portfolio chronologically or by subject.\n9. 'Look at your earliest work from this quarter and your most recent. Can you see how you have improved?'\n10. Celebrate the portfolio as a record of learning.",
