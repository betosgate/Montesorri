The squeegee technique requires bilateral coordination (one hand holds the squeegee, the other wipes the blade) and top-to-bottom sequencing. Start with a mirror at child height if windows are too high. The spray bottle itself is wonderful for hand strength development — the repeated squeezing action strengthens the same muscles used for writing. A tiny amount of vinegar in the water creates a streak-free solution. Let the child wash the same window multiple times if they enjoy it; repetition is how mastery develops.",

Words are getting longer and more complex — many include consonant blends (br, cr, thr) alongside phonograms.

Dictation (parent says word, child builds it) is particularly valuable because it requires the child to segment sounds, identify phonograms by ear, and translate sounds to letters. If the child struggles with a word, break it into parts: 'cr-u-nch — what do you hear first? cr. Then? u. Then? nch — that ends with our /ch/!' The word lists can be kept for repeated reading practice; fluency comes from rereading familiar words until they become automatic.",

The black color represents the dense, solid nature of things. This may seem overly symbolic, but children absorb these associations effortlessly. The Farm Game is a traditional Montessori grammar activity: write noun labels for everything on a table or in a room, and the child places them. This makes nouns tangible.

Many children want to repeat it immediately, finding the whole sequence deeply satisfying. The circular scrubbing motion prepares the hand for cursive writing. The sensory contrast between the wet/soapy/clean/dry surfaces engages the tactile sense. Some Montessori guides consider table scrubbing a meditative activity — the rhythmic motion and focus create a flow state. Do not rush the child through the steps.",

Let the child decorate it and post it prominently. Do NOT redo their work if it is imperfect — this communicates that their contribution is not good enough. Instead, occasionally work alongside them, modeling technique. Rotate responsibilities monthly or quarterly so the child builds a full repertoire of skills.
