The squeegee technique requires bilateral coordination (one hand holds the squeegee, the other wipes the blade) and top-to-bottom sequencing. Start with a mirror at child height if windows are too high. The spray bottle itself is wonderful for hand strength development — the repeated squeezing action strengthens the same muscles used for writing. A tiny amount of vinegar in the water creates a streak-free solution. Let the child wash the same window multiple times if they enjoy it; repetition is how mastery develops.",

Words are getting longer and more complex — many include consonant blends (br, cr, thr) alongside phonograms. This is natural progression: the child combines multiple phonetic strategies simultaneously. Dictation (parent says word, child builds it) is particularly valuable because it requires the child to segment sounds, identify phonograms by ear, and translate sounds to letters. If the child struggles with a word, break it into parts: 'cr-u-nch — what do you hear first? cr. Then? u. Then? nch — that ends with our /ch/!' The word lists can be kept for repeated reading practice; fluency comes from rereading familiar words until they become automatic.",

The land/water form pairs are a Montessori hallmark: every land form has a corresponding water form (island/lake, peninsula/gulf, archipelago/system of lakes). This dual presentation helps the child understand that land and water define each other. Real-world connections are powerful: if you live near any islands, relate the lesson to your local geography.",

Experiment together! This is also a wonderful seasonal activity — fall leaves produce stunning warm-colored prints. The prints make beautiful cards, wrapping paper, or journal covers.

When both units AND tens require exchange, the child must work through a chain of exchanges — this is exactly what happens in the standard written algorithm when you borrow across multiple columns. Some children find this cascading exchange confusing at first. If so, break it into explicit steps: (1) Check units — enough? No → exchange from tens. (2) Check tens — enough now? No → exchange from hundreds. (3) Now work through each subtraction. This step-by-step approach builds confidence. Creating their own problems is motivating and develops number sense — the child learns that the starting number must be larger than the number being subtracted.",

If your family celebrates Easter, the Nowruz information adds a global perspective. If your family celebrates Nowruz, the Easter information adds breadth. If your family celebrates neither, both are presented as fascinating cultural traditions. The Haft-sin table is particularly interesting: seven items beginning with the letter 's' in Persian, each symbolizing something important (health, beauty, patience, sunrise, love, fertility, medicine).
