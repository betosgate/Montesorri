Compare: DINER (long i, one n — a place to eat) vs. DINNER (short i, double n — the meal itself). LATER (long a, one t) vs. LATTER (short a, double t). The double consonant is a signal: the vowel before it is short!",
          "mascot_explanation": "This is a really neat trick! When you see two consonants together like 'bb', 'tt', or 'pp', they're like a signal to the vowel right before them. They tell that vowel to make its short sound, like the 'a' in \"apple\" or the 'i' in \"igloo.\" For example, in \"DINNER,\" the double 'n' makes the 'i' sound short, but in \"DINER,\" with only one 'n', the 'i' sounds long, like its name!",

PITCH changes by changing the length of the vibrating air column — when you cover holes on the recorder, you lengthen the column (lower pitch). When you uncover holes, you shorten it (higher pitch). That is why more fingers down = lower notes!",
          "mascot_explanation": "Next up are woodwind instruments, like the recorder or a flute. For these, it's the *air* inside the instrument that vibrates, not the instrument itself! When you blow into a recorder, the air inside starts to wiggle. Covering up the holes makes the air column longer, which makes a lower sound, and uncovering them makes the air column shorter for a higher sound. So, more holes covered means a deeper note!",

A trombone changes pitch by sliding the tube longer (lower) or shorter (higher). PERCUSSION: Drums, xylophone, cymbals. Something is struck and vibrates. Bigger drums = lower pitch. Smaller xylophone bars = higher pitch. Same principle as everything else!",
          "mascot_explanation": "This slide talks about two more families! Brass instruments, like trumpets, are super cool because your *lips* vibrate against a mouthpiece, and that vibration travels through the long metal tube. Percussion instruments, like drums or xylophones, make noise when you hit them, and the surface starts to vibrate.

If any family members play instruments, having them demonstrate while the child explains the science is powerful.

The recorder connection is direct: the child has been changing pitch by covering holes — now they understand the physics behind it.
