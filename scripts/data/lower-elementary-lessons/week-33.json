Which one do you want to become an expert on?'\n4. Once the child selects their topic, help them brainstorm what they already know and what they want to learn more about.\n5. Create a project planning sheet: title, 3-5 subtopics they want to cover, materials they will need, and a timeline for completion (across weeks 33-34).\n6. Begin gathering reference materials — books, notes from earlier lessons, maps, and images.\n7. 'This is YOUR big project. You are the author, the illustrator, and the researcher.

Consider making this real by helping your child set up actual jars at home. Even small amounts — birthday money, coins found in the couch — become meaningful when the child is making conscious decisions about allocation. The 'Give' jar is especially important in Montessori philosophy, which emphasizes community responsibility and grace and courtesy.

Design thinking — identifying a problem, brainstorming solutions, prototyping, and presenting — is a 21st-century skill used by engineers, entrepreneurs, and artists alike. The child's invention does not need to be realistic; the thinking process matters more than the feasibility. A child who designs a 'rainbow machine that turns pollution into flowers' is exercising the same creative muscles as an engineer designing a real air filter. Celebrate imagination over realism. The presentation component adds language skills (explaining, persuading) to the art and science. If your child wants to build a 3D model, this becomes a powerful hands-on engineering activity. Save these inventions — they make wonderful additions to the portfolio and the week 35 presentations.",

Most powerfully, the equity statistics — about access to clean water, education, food, and shelter — naturally generate empathy and a sense of social responsibility. Let your child sit with any emotions that arise. Some children feel sad about inequality, others feel grateful, others feel motivated to help. All responses are valid. The hands-on counting with 100 objects is crucial for making abstract statistics concrete — seeing 60 beans in the 'Asia' pile versus 5 in the 'North America' pile is worth more than any lecture on population distribution.

If you have a small solar cell kit (available cheaply online), watching sunlight power an LED is genuinely magical for children. The comparison chart develops analytical thinking: every energy source has advantages AND challenges, and wise decision-making requires understanding both.

The three-tier goal structure teaches time horizons — understanding that some rewards require patience and sustained effort. The calculations involve division (how many weeks to reach a goal), multiplication (weekly savings times number of weeks), and subtraction (remaining amount after each deposit). Consider making this plan real: help the child set up actual savings toward their short-term goal. The savings tracker provides visual feedback that maintains motivation. Research consistently shows that children who learn financial literacy early make better financial decisions as adults. The 'money tips for a friend' component reinforces learning through teaching — the child must articulate what they know clearly enough to advise someone else. This week's personal finance unit has been a real-world math masterclass, and this plan makes it personal and permanent.",

The SDGs are particularly powerful for children because they are concrete and action-oriented — each goal has clear targets that even young people can contribute to. Letting the child choose their priority goals reveals their values and passions. Do not push particular goals; let them gravitate toward what moves them. Some children will care most about animal conservation, others about hunger, others about education. All choices are valid. The key insight: global problems require global cooperation, AND they require individual action. Both matter. This connects to Montessori's vision of cosmic education leading to peace — Maria Montessori was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize three times because she believed education could create a more peaceful world.",

When a child thinks about decisions affecting people 200 years from now, they develop long-term thinking that transcends short-term convenience.
