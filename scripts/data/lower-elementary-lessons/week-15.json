    "instructions": "1. Ask: 'What does it mean when someone says he ran like the wind? Did he actually become wind? No — it is a comparison!'\n2. Introduce SIMILE: a comparison using 'like' or 'as.' 'She was as brave as a lion.' 'The stars twinkled like diamonds.'\n3. Introduce METAPHOR: a comparison WITHOUT like or as. 'He is a rock.' 'Life is a journey.' The thing IS the other thing.\n4. Compare: simile says something is LIKE something else. Metaphor says it IS something else.\n5. Find examples in read-aloud books from previous weeks.\n6. Simile and metaphor sorting activity: classify 15 sentences.\n7. Students write 5 similes and 5 metaphors in their journals.",
