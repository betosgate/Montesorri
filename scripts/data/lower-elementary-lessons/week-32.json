Video recording (with the child's permission) can be a powerful learning tool — children are often surprised by how they appear. Always lead with encouragement before suggestions.

The hands-on activities connect abstract math to concrete daily experiences. The cooking station is especially powerful because measuring ingredients provides immediate physical feedback. At home, continue making these connections: have your child help measure ingredients, discuss what time 'quarter past' means, ask what fraction of a pizza remains after dinner. The money connection is particularly useful: explaining that a quarter is literally 'one quarter of a dollar' reinforces both math and financial literacy. The fair sharing station connects fractions to the social concept of fairness — a motivating context for children.
