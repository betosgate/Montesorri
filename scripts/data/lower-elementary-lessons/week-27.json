Think of a biome as a big region on Earth with its own special weather and plants, like a hot desert, a cold tundra, or a rainy rainforest.

          "mascot_explanation": "Now for step two: picking your living things!

Your words of affirmation at this moment carry enormous weight. Enjoy the weekend break and come back refreshed for Q4!",
