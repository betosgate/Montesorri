Practice identifying rhyme schemes in 3-4 short poems.\n5. Introduce rhythm/meter: clap the beats. Some syllables are stressed (strong), some unstressed (weak).\n6. Clap out the rhythm of 'Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star' — da DUM da DUM da DUM da DUM.\n7. Students copy a favorite poem and mark the rhyme scheme and stressed syllables.",

    "instructions": "1. Read two poems: one with strict rhyme and meter, one in free verse.\n2. Compare: free verse has no required rhyme scheme, no fixed rhythm. It focuses on imagery and emotion.\n3. But free verse is NOT just chopped-up prose — it uses line breaks purposefully, creates rhythm through repetition, and relies on vivid images.\n4. Read examples of free verse: show how line breaks create pauses and emphasis.\n5. Brainstorm topics: nature, the Greek islands, a character from mythology, the sea.\n6. Write a free verse poem together as a class.\n7. Students write their own free verse poem (at least 8 lines).",
