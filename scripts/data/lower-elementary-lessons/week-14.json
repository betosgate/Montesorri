Have students listen for rhyming words.\n3. Introduce rhyme scheme notation: label the last word's sound with a letter (AABB, ABAB, ABCB).\n4. Practice identifying rhyme schemes in 3-4 short poems.\n5. Introduce rhythm/meter: clap the beats. Some syllables are stressed (strong), some unstressed (weak).\n6. Clap out the rhythm of 'Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star' — da DUM da DUM da DUM da DUM.\n7. Students copy a favorite poem and mark the rhyme scheme and stressed syllables.",
