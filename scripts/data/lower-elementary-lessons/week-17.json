The friction experiment is particularly engaging: children love comparing how far a car travels on different surfaces. Connect forces to simple machines: levers reduce applied force needed, wheels reduce friction, inclined planes work with gravity. For an extension, discuss why space is different (no friction, microgravity) — this fascinates children and reinforces the concepts by showing what happens without these forces.",
