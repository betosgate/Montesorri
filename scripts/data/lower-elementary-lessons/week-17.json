In everyday conversation, occasionally ask: 'Did that happen BECAUSE of the first thing (so), or was it different from what you expected (but)?'

The first castles (around 900 AD) were simple wooden towers on hills called 'motte and bailey' castles. Over centuries, they evolved into the massive stone fortresses we see in movies!",
          "mascot_explanation": "This is where our castle story begins! Way back in the Middle Ages, people needed to be safe from enemies, so they built these huge castles.

CURTAIN WALLS were thick stone walls (up to 20 feet thick!). TOWERS gave archers high positions to shoot down at attackers. ARROW SLITS were narrow windows — you could shoot out, but enemies could not shoot in.",
          "mascot_explanation": "Now we're looking at how castles were built to keep people safe. See that water all around? That's a moat, and it made it super hard for bad guys to get close.

Applaud genuinely. Never criticize mistakes during or after the performance; instead, ask what the child was proud of. If the child is very nervous, start with performing for a pet or stuffed animal, then work up to family. The reflection writing (how did it feel?) builds self-awareness. Consider making family performances a regular event — Friday night concerts are a beautiful tradition.",
