Introduce drama vocabulary: characters, dialogue, stage directions, scene, act.\n3. Show a formatted play script. Point out: character names before dialogue, stage directions in brackets/italics.\n4. Read a short play excerpt together, assigning roles.\n5. Discuss: How is reading a play different from reading a story? (No narrator — everything is told through dialogue and action.)\n6.

Children are often astonished that books were once hand-copied — it reframes their relationship with books entirely. The comparison to the internet is powerful: Gutenberg's press did for the 1400s what the internet did for the 1990s — it democratized information. If your child is interested, discuss how the printing press also enabled the spread of misinformation, just as the internet does today. Critical thinking about information is timeless.",

Explain harmony: Medieval music was mostly one melody (monophonic). Renaissance music had multiple voices singing different notes that sound beautiful together (polyphonic).\n5. Listen for harmony in a recording.\n6. Sing or play a simple round (like 'Row, Row, Row Your Boat') — this demonstrates harmony.\n7.
