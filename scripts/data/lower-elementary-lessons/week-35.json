The cooking station is particularly powerful because it connects abstract fractions to concrete, delicious reality. If your child struggles with comparing fractions, use the pizza models: which is bigger, 1/3 or 1/4 of a pizza? The visual makes it clear. For summer, involve your child in cooking regularly — measuring ingredients is the best fraction practice available. Building projects also reinforce measurement skills. The key insight is that fractions and measurement are not school math — they are life math. Children who see math in everyday contexts develop a positive mathematical identity that serves them throughout their education.",

A simple sketch and a few notes each week keeps the observation habit alive. Visit new environments: beaches, mountains, forests, even city parks offer different ecosystems to observe.
