The connection flower-to-fruit surprises many children: every fruit was once a flower! Plant the seeds and track their growth over the coming weeks — this ongoing observation reinforces the life cycle concept. The celery-in-colored-water from Day 2 should show color in the leaves by now, beautifully demonstrating stem transport.",

The results will be clear: seeds with water will germinate (both light and dark), seeds without water will not. This teaches that water is essential for germination while light is less critical at the initial stage (roots grow first, toward water). The daily observation and recording builds scientific discipline. The soaked bean dissection is fascinating — the embryo is visible to the naked eye and stunning under a magnifying glass. Keep the experiment going for 2-3 weeks and help the child transfer observations to their science journal. This connects directly to the plant parts and life cycle lessons from earlier in the week.",

Introduce body percussion: clap, stomp, snap, pat knees, tap chest.\n4. Read simple rhythm notation: quarter notes (ta), eighth notes (ti-ti), rests (shhh).\n5. Practice reading and performing 4-beat rhythm patterns.\n6. Layer rhythms: one person claps while another stomps a different pattern.\n7. Connect to math: rhythm patterns are like number patterns!\n8. Create original 8-beat rhythm patterns.\n9. Perform rhythm compositions using body percussion.\n10.

    "parent_notes": "Body percussion is an accessible, equipment-free way to experience music fundamentally. The physical engagement — clapping, stomping, snapping — develops coordination and timing while making rhythm tangible. The connection to math is real: rhythm patterns are mathematical patterns played in time. The quarter note/eighth note distinction is foundational music literacy. Layering rhythms (one person stomps while another claps) develops the ability to maintain a pattern while hearing a different one — a skill essential for ensemble music. Encourage rhythm play throughout the day: create a family rhythm, tap rhythms on the dinner table, notice the rhythms in walking and breathing.",
