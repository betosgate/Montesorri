After reading, ask the child to tell you about what they read (retelling for comprehension).\n6. Introduce the Reading Journal: a blank notebook where they will record the title, author, date, and a short response for each book.\n7. Have the child make their first entry.\n8.

The key is that the child CHOOSES their book — intrinsic motivation is central to Montessori. Good chapter book series for this age: Magic Tree House, Junie B. Jones, Cam Jansen, Mercy Watson, The Boxcar Children. Don't correct during silent reading; note struggles for later phonics or vocabulary work.

If your child struggles to identify the operation, teach the keywords approach: 'total,' 'altogether,' 'sum' = addition; 'left,' 'remaining,' 'difference' = subtraction.

Darkening the room and physically seeing light and shadow on the globe makes the abstract concept of day/night concrete and memorable. The revolution demonstration (walking the globe around the lamp) helps children understand why we have years and seasons. The Earth's tilt (23.5 degrees) is the key to understanding seasons — it's not about distance from the Sun (a common misconception). When the Northern Hemisphere tilts toward the Sun, sunlight hits more directly = summer. When it tilts away, sunlight hits at an angle = winter. This is subtle and may need revisiting. The 'trips around the Sun' birthday calculation is a Montessori classic — it personalizes the astronomical concept and connects to the child's own life. Some classrooms do a 'Sun birthday' walk where the child carries the globe around a candle (Sun) once for each year of their age.",

Be sensitive to your own family's religious or cultural background — include your traditions alongside others, neither above nor below. If you celebrate any of these holidays, share your personal experience! If not, approach them all with equal curiosity and respect.
