    "instructions": "1. Write the word 'DEBATE' on the board and ask what it means.\n2. Explain: a debate is when two sides share different opinions and support them with facts.\n3. Introduce the framework: Claim (what you believe), Evidence (facts that support it), Reasoning (why the evidence matters).\n4. Read aloud two sample arguments about a familiar topic (e.g., 'Should recess be longer?').\n5. Have the child identify the claim, evidence, and reasoning in each.\n6. Discuss: Which argument was stronger? Why?\n7. Child writes their own claim statement on a topic of their choice.",

Introduce Ferdinand Magellan and his goal: find a western route to the Spice Islands by sailing around South America.\n3. Trace the route on the globe: Spain → Atlantic → South America → Strait of Magellan → Pacific → Philippines → Indian Ocean → Africa → back to Spain.\n4. Discuss hardships: starvation, scurvy, storms, Magellan's death in the Philippines.\n5. Key fact: 5 ships left, only 1 returned. 270 men departed, 18 survived.\n6. Discuss: What did this voyage prove? (The Earth is round and much bigger than anyone thought.)\n7. Child writes a diary entry as a crew member.",

If you can't obtain this specific book, any age-appropriate Magellan biography works. The character trait analysis is important: Montessori education at this age emphasizes moral reasoning, and discussing the nuances of traits like 'determination vs. stubbornness' develops sophisticated thinking. The final reflection ('a trait I share') builds personal connection to history.",
