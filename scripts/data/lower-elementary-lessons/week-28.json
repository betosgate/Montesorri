They were looking for a place where they could practice their religion freely. It was a super tough first winter, and they almost didn't make it, but thankfully, a Wampanoag man named Squanto helped them out! He taught them how to grow corn and catch fish, which helped them survive, and that led to a big harvest feast that year we often call the first Thanksgiving.",
