    "instructions": "1. Review: What is a paragraph? (A group of sentences about one topic.)\n2. Introduce the three parts: topic sentence (tells the main idea), supporting details (give facts, examples, reasons), closing sentence (wraps it up).\n3. Read a sample paragraph together. Identify the topic sentence, supporting details, and closing sentence.\n4. Color-code: underline topic sentence in red, supporting details in blue, closing sentence in green.\n5. Read a second sample paragraph and have the child identify the parts independently.\n6. Discuss: What makes a strong supporting detail? (Specific facts, examples, or reasons — not vague statements.)\n7. Child drafts a body paragraph on a topic of their choice using the three-part structure.\n8.

Three jobs of the skeleton: support (holds you up), protection (skull protects brain, ribs protect heart and lungs), movement (bones are levers for muscles).\n5.

Key insight: When numerators are the same, the fraction with the SMALLER denominator is LARGER (bigger pieces).\n3. Compare 2/3 and 3/4. These are harder. Use fraction strips to line them up.\n4. Introduce common denominators: convert both to twelfths. 2/3 = 8/12, 3/4 = 9/12. Now compare: 8/12 < 9/12.\n5. Practice the symbols: < (less than), > (greater than), = (equal).\n6.

    "parent_notes": "Multi-color printing requires patience and planning — excellent skills for children to develop. The registration concept (aligning layers) is challenging but rewarding. Do not expect perfection; slight misalignment creates interesting artistic effects. Pattern creation connects to math (repetition, symmetry, tessellation). Children's prints make wonderful gifts — consider using them for greeting cards, wrapping paper, or framed art. This project can extend over multiple sessions if the child is engaged. The connection to industrial printing (newspapers, books, textiles) ties back to the Industrial Revolution history studies.",
