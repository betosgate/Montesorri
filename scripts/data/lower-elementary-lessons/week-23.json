Identify the topic sentence, supporting details, and closing sentence.\n4. Color-code: underline topic sentence in red, supporting details in blue, closing sentence in green.\n5. Read a second sample paragraph and have the child identify the parts independently.\n6. Discuss: What makes a strong supporting detail?

    "instructions": "1. Discuss: Why do we plan meals? (Save time, eat healthy, reduce waste, save money.)\n2. Review the five food groups: fruits, vegetables, grains, protein, dairy. A balanced meal includes at least three groups.\n3. Show a sample daily menu: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and one snack.\n4. Brainstorm together: What meals does your family enjoy? List favorites.\n5. Introduce the concept of variety: different proteins, different vegetables through the week.\n6. Child plans meals for 3 days, ensuring balance and variety.\n7. Create a neat, organized menu on paper or a chart.\n8. Bonus: make a grocery list for one day's meals.",
