    "parent_notes": "Folk music connects beautifully to Montessori geography and cultural studies. 'This Land Is Your Land' is accessible, catchy, and contains real geographic vocabulary. Woody Guthrie wrote it in 1940, and it has become an unofficial anthem. Some versions include verses about poverty and inequality — share these if you wish, as Montessori encourages honest discussion of social justice. If your child plays an instrument, the song uses just 3 chords (G, C, D) and is perfect for beginning guitar or ukulele. Throughout the year, we will learn folk songs from each continent we study, building a repertoire that connects music to cultural geography.",

The key concept is SEQUENCE — plants had to come first (oxygen), then small animals (insects feeding on plants), then larger animals (amphibians). This sequential thinking is important for understanding cause and effect in history and science. Tiktaalik is a wonderful transitional fossil to discuss — it was discovered in 2004 and shows features of both fish and amphibians. If your child is fascinated, Neil Shubin's 'Your Inner Fish' is an excellent adult-level resource you can adapt for storytelling. The giant insect fact (dragonflies with 2.5-foot wingspans) never fails to amaze children and is scientifically accurate — the high oxygen content of the Carboniferous period allowed insects to grow much larger than today.",

The celery experiment is a classic demonstration: within 24 hours, you should see colored water travel up the stalk, and if you use a leafy celery stalk, the leaves may show color too. This makes the abstract concept of water transport visible and memorable. If your child asks about flowers and seeds (which are also plant parts), acknowledge them but save detailed study for later — today focuses on the three vegetative parts.",

Be patient with the initial sound quality — it improves quickly with practice. Hot Cross Buns uses only three notes and is very satisfying to play. Encourage 5 minutes of daily practice but do not push — music should remain joyful. If your child finds recorder frustrating, ensure the instrument is of reasonable quality; very cheap recorders can be genuinely difficult to play in tune. Yamaha and Aulos make good, affordable student recorders.",
