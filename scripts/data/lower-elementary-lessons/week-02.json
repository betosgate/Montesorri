Have the child trace the letter in a sand tray first, then on paper.\n5. Repeat with 'a' — show how it starts like 'o' but adds a tail stroke.\n6. Repeat with 'c' — an open 'o'.\n7. Repeat with 'd' — like 'a' but with a tall stroke.\n8. Practice each letter 5 times on lined paper.\n9. Write simple words using these letters: 'dad', 'add', 'cad'.\n10.

The sand tray provides sensory feedback before committing to paper. If your child struggles with pencil grip, consider a pencil grip aid. Practice should feel calm and meditative, not stressful.

If you still have the island and lake models from Monday, line all four models up for comparison.

This abstraction is intentional — it prepares the child for purely mental or written math. If your child needs to touch and count each bead, that is fine. Over time, they will begin to see '4 beads in the hundreds row' as '400' without counting. Numbers with zeros are the biggest challenge — make sure to practice these. If you do not have a Montessori bead frame, you can substitute with an abacus or even create one using pipe cleaners and beads.",

If your child is left-handed, demonstrate as a mirror image or find left-handed sewing tutorials. Threading the needle is often the hardest part; a needle threader is a worthwhile investment.

Neither preference is better; both tools are scaffolds toward mental math.

The key concept is SEQUENCE — plants had to come first (oxygen), then small animals (insects feeding on plants), then larger animals (amphibians). This sequential thinking is important for understanding cause and effect in history and science. Tiktaalik is a wonderful transitional fossil to discuss — it was discovered in 2004 and shows features of both fish and amphibians. If your child is fascinated, Neil Shubin's 'Your Inner Fish' is an excellent adult-level resource you can adapt for storytelling. The giant insect fact (dragonflies with 2.5-foot wingspans) never fails to amaze children and is scientifically accurate — the high oxygen content of the Carboniferous period allowed insects to grow much larger than today.",

Encourage 5 minutes of daily practice but do not push — music should remain joyful. If your child finds recorder frustrating, ensure the instrument is of reasonable quality; very cheap recorders can be genuinely difficult to play in tune. Yamaha and Aulos make good, affordable student recorders.",
