It is not just a red liquid — it is a complex mixture.\n3. RED BLOOD CELLS: disk-shaped, carry oxygen, make blood red. Billions in your body.\n4.

A single DROP of blood contains about 5 million red blood cells, 7,000 white blood cells, and 250,000 platelets — all floating in a yellowish liquid called plasma. Let us meet each member of this team."},{"type":"instruction","step":2,"text":"RED BLOOD CELLS are shaped like tiny donuts (disks with a dip in the middle). Their job: carry OXYGEN from the lungs to every cell in the body, and carry CARBON DIOXIDE waste back to the lungs. They contain HEMOGLOBIN, an iron-rich protein that grabs oxygen and gives blood its red color. Your body makes about 2 MILLION new red blood cells every SECOND!"},{"type":"instruction","step":3,"text":"WHITE BLOOD CELLS are your body's ARMY. When germs invade — bacteria, viruses, parasites — white blood cells attack and destroy them. Some white blood cells eat germs (like tiny Pac-Men!). Others produce ANTIBODIES — proteins that mark germs for destruction. When you get a fever, it means your white blood cells are fighting hard! PLATELETS are tiny cell fragments that rush to cuts and wounds, sticking together to form CLOTS that stop bleeding."},{"type":"instruction","step":4,"text":"PLASMA is the liquid part of blood — about 55% of your blood volume. It is mostly water but carries proteins, hormones, nutrients, and waste products throughout the body. There are four main BLOOD TYPES: A, B, AB, and O, determined by markers on your red blood cells. Knowing your blood type matters for BLOOD DONATION — sharing your blood can save someone's life during surgery or after an accident!"},{"type":"activity","prompt":"1.

The 'army' metaphor for white blood cells is effective and memorable. The math activity (calculating blood volume) personalizes the information. Blood types are a fun fact that many children want to know about themselves — check vaccination records or ask your doctor. Blood donation is an age-appropriate topic that teaches altruism and community responsibility. If your child is squeamish about blood, reassure them that this is learning about how their own body works — understanding reduces fear. The hemoglobin/iron connection explains why iron-rich foods are important for health.","age_adaptations":null,"sort_order":24},

The life-size scale makes it dramatic and personal. The da Vinci connection adds historical depth. Display these portraits prominently — they generate conversation and reinforce learning. The activity develops body awareness and spatial reasoning. Children are often surprised by how much of their body is filled with blood vessels.

The portraits make excellent gifts for grandparents or can be revisited later in the year when studying other body systems.","age_adaptations":null,"sort_order":25}
