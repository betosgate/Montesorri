The themes of obsolescence, adaptation, and finding purpose are sophisticated. Mike Mulligan was published in 1939 — itself a historical document! The personal reflection about change is important; children this age are experiencing many changes and benefit from processing their feelings through writing. This closes out a wonderful thematic week connecting history, science, art, and literature.",
