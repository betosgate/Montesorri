You heat water until it turns into steam, and steam is like a super-powered puff of air that pushes things.

          "mascot_explanation": "Before we dive into the story, this slide is like a little preview. It reminds us about the Industrial Revolution, which is when lots of new machines were invented. This story is special because it’s about a steam shovel that was super new once, but then even newer machines came along and it got replaced. It’s all about how things change!",

The slide asks us to wonder if Mary Anne, the steam shovel, is doing a bad job – but she's not! It's just that technology keeps getting updated, like when you get a new video game that's even better than the old one. We’ll also talk about how Mike and Mary Anne might be feeling about all this change.",

    "parent_notes": "This picture book, though aimed at a younger audience, resonates deeply with older elementary students when framed in the context of the Industrial Revolution. The themes of obsolescence, adaptation, and finding purpose are sophisticated. Mike Mulligan was published in 1939 — itself a historical document! The personal reflection about change is important; children this age are experiencing many changes and benefit from processing their feelings through writing. This closes out a wonderful thematic week connecting history, science, art, and literature.",
