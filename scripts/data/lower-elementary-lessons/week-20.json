The absorption/reflection explanation of color is profound: children realize that color is not IN objects but is a product of how objects interact with light. Black absorbing all light explains why dark cars get hotter — a practical connection. The ROY G. BIV mnemonic helps with spectrum order. Connect to art: mixing paints works differently from mixing light (subtractive vs. additive color mixing).",
