The slide explains that using only short sentences can make your writing sound choppy, and using too many long sentences can make it hard to follow.

Reading the paragraph aloud is the best test: if it sounds natural and engaging, the sentence variety is good. Encourage your child to read published authors and notice their sentence patterns. Beverly Cleary, for example, masterfully mixes short punchy sentences with longer compound ones. This awareness transfers directly to the child's own writing.",

Present these honestly as part of the full picture. The route-tracing activity on a world map gives children a visceral sense of how FAR these sailors traveled in tiny wooden ships.

For extension, explore why we see our reflection in water (still water acts as a mirror), and why rough surfaces (like a wall) do not create reflections (they scatter light in all directions, called diffuse reflection).
