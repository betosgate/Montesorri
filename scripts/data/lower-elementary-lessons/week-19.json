This is why mirrors create clear images — the reflected light is organized, not scattered."

The simplest version uses a tall milk carton with mirrors taped at 45-degree angles at top and bottom. Pre-made periscope kits are also available inexpensively. The law of reflection (angle in = angle out) is a fundamental physics concept that children can verify experimentally. For extension, explore why we see our reflection in water (still water acts as a mirror), and why rough surfaces (like a wall) do not create reflections (they scatter light in all directions, called diffuse reflection). Connect to navigation: explorers used mirrors and sextants to navigate by reflecting starlight.",
