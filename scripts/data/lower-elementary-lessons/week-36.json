If you notice specific gaps during the tournament, note them for summer practice. Multiplication fluency develops over time — some children need additional repetition into the summer. Flash card practice (5-10 minutes daily) or multiplication apps can maintain skills without feeling burdensome.

Maria Montessori believed that children need to understand the grand narrative — from the creation of the universe to the present — to feel connected, purposeful, and responsible. When a child can tell this story in their own words, they have internalized one of the most powerful frameworks for understanding existence. The personal ending — placing themselves within the story — is profoundly meaningful. It answers the existential question every child unconsciously asks: Where do I fit? The answer, in cosmic education, is: You are the latest chapter in a story that stretches back to the beginning of time, and YOUR choices will shape the next chapter. Read the child's version with reverence. This is one of the most important pieces of writing they will produce this year.",

How do rocks relate to the water cycle? The topic with the most connections reveals which scientific domain serves as a hub for understanding. For summer, nurture this systems-thinking approach: when you observe something in nature, ask How does this connect to other things we know? A garden alone offers connections between plants, soil, water, insects, weather, and chemistry. Systems thinking is one of the most valued skills in modern science and engineering.",
