Introduce the definition: a noun is a word that names a person, place, thing, or idea.\n3. Present the Montessori grammar symbol: the large black triangle.\n4. Walk around the room pointing to objects — each name is a noun.\n5. Sort noun cards into four categories: people, places, things, ideas.\n6. Give each child a set of small black triangles.\n7. Write a sentence on the board. Students place triangles above each noun.\n8. Practice with 5 sentences of increasing complexity.\n9. Students write 3 sentences of their own and mark the nouns.\n10. Create a 'noun collection' page in language journals.",

Ivan's first-person narration is distinctive: short chapters, simple but profound observations, and gentle humor. The book naturally connects to science (gorilla behavior), geography (Africa), and art (Ivan draws throughout the story).

Natural objects are ideal subjects because they have organic, forgiving shapes (unlike geometric objects where errors are obvious).

Ivan's fading memories of the jungle are poignant — children may relate to forgetting details of places they have lived or visited. The theme of art as emotional expression is powerful for children who may struggle to verbalize their feelings. Ivan's art gives them permission to express through drawing what they cannot say in words. The short chapter format is excellent for struggling readers — each chapter feels like an accomplishment. If your child is moved by the animal welfare themes, validate those feelings while keeping the discussion age-appropriate. The real Ivan was eventually moved to a zoo — but do not spoil this yet.",

The word problems require choosing the right skip count, which develops mathematical reasoning. Introducing 3s and 4s at the end plants seeds for future weeks. If your child is excelling, encourage them to explore more skip counting patterns independently.

Experiment 2: Compare melting speed in different conditions (warm hand, cold desk, sunlight).\n6. Discuss MELTING POINT: the temperature at which solid becomes liquid (0 degrees C for water).\n7. Discuss FREEZING: remove heat and liquid becomes solid. Same temperature, opposite direction.\n8. Experiment 3: Place a wet paper towel in sunlight. Observe evaporation over time.\n9.

Well, this slide is telling us that adding heat energy makes those tiny pieces move super fast! When they move fast enough, ice (which is solid) can start to wiggle and jiggle until it becomes water (which is a liquid).

This connection becomes more explicit later, but even now, children are internalizing proportional relationships through music. Percussion instruments are ideal for beginners because they produce immediate, satisfying sounds without the complexity of pitch. If you do not have instruments, household items work beautifully: wooden spoons on pots, rice in a sealed container (shaker), hands on a table (drum). The ensemble experience — playing together — teaches listening, cooperation, and timing. Consider finding rhythm games or apps for additional practice.",

This leads to the insight that 'metal' is not one thing — different metals have different properties. The design challenge (choosing materials for specific purposes) connects science to engineering and everyday decision-making. Extend this at home by discussing the materials in your house: why are pipes made of copper? Why are windows made of glass? Why are tires made of rubber?
