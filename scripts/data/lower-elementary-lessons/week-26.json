    "instructions": "1. Ask: 'Have you ever tried to convince someone of something? That's persuasion!'\n2. Define persuasive writing: writing that tries to make the reader agree with your opinion.\n3. Introduce three key elements: claim (your opinion), reasons (why you think so), evidence (proof).\n4. Read 2-3 short persuasive passages. Identify the claim, reasons, and evidence in each.\n5. Discuss: What makes an argument convincing? What makes it weak?\n6. Brainstorm potential persuasive topics.",
