    "instructions": "1. Review paragraph structure: topic sentence, supporting details, closing sentence.\n2. Read a paragraph WITHOUT transitions. It sounds choppy.\n3. Read the same paragraph WITH transitions (first, also, in addition, finally). It flows smoothly.\n4. Introduce categories of transitions: sequence (first, next, then, finally), addition (also, in addition, furthermore), contrast (however, but, on the other hand), conclusion (in conclusion, finally, therefore).\n5. Child adds transitions to a paragraph that is missing them.\n6. Practice: write a new paragraph using at least 4 transition words.\n7. Peer-edit exercise: read your paragraph aloud — do the transitions help it flow?\n8. Create a transition words bookmark for reference.",

    "description": "Children explore rhythm using simple percussion instruments. They learn to maintain a steady beat, create rhythmic patterns, and layer multiple rhythms together to create a simple ensemble piece.",
    "instructions": "1. Discuss rhythm: the pattern of sounds in time. Music has a steady BEAT — like a heartbeat.\n2. Clap a steady beat together. Feel how it stays constant.\n3. Introduce rhythm instruments: tambourine, shaker, rhythm sticks, drum, wood block.\n4. Each instrument makes a different sound but can all keep the beat.\n5. Practice: play the steady beat on different instruments.\n6. Introduce rhythmic patterns: quarter notes (ta), eighth notes (ti-ti), rest (shh).\n7. Layer rhythms: one person plays the steady beat while another plays a pattern on top.\n8. Create a simple four-measure rhythmic composition and perform it.",
