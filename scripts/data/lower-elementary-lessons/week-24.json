    "description": "Children strengthen their paragraph writing by learning transition words that connect ideas smoothly. They practice using words like first, next, also, however, and finally to guide the reader through their writing.",
    "instructions": "1. Review paragraph structure: topic sentence, supporting details, closing sentence.\n2. Read a paragraph WITHOUT transitions. It sounds choppy.\n3. Read the same paragraph WITH transitions (first, also, in addition, finally). It flows smoothly.\n4. Introduce categories of transitions: sequence (first, next, then, finally), addition (also, in addition, furthermore), contrast (however, but, on the other hand), conclusion (in conclusion, finally, therefore).\n5. Child adds transitions to a paragraph that is missing them.\n6. Practice: write a new paragraph using at least 4 transition words.\n7. Peer-edit exercise: read your paragraph aloud — do the transitions help it flow?\n8. Create a transition words bookmark for reference.",

Tips for success: clay should be room temperature, and the child should work slowly and rotate consistently. If walls get too thin, they will collapse; if too thick, the pot will be heavy and may crack while drying. Air-dry clay is available at any craft store and requires no kiln. Once dry, pots can be painted with acrylic paint.",

Each stroke gets lighter and lighter. By the bottom, you are painting with barely tinted water. This makes a beautiful sky!'",
          "mascot_explanation": "Get ready for a gradient wash – this is how we make colors fade from dark to light, perfect for a sunset or a beautiful sky! You'll start with a strong color at the top, then, with each new stroke you make going down, you'll add a little more clean water to your brush. This makes the color get lighter and lighter until it's almost clear at the bottom. It’s like magic how the color just melts away!",

          "mascot_explanation": "Here we have two more cool tricks: \"wet-on-wet\" is when you paint on paper that's already a little wet with clean water. Watch how the colors spread out like a beautiful bloom! Then there's \"wet-on-dry,\" where you paint on dry paper, which gives you really sharp, clear lines for details like trees or buildings. It’s fun to see how different they look!",

    "parent_notes": "Watercolor can be frustrating for children used to the forgiving nature of crayons or markers because watercolor requires working quickly and accepting some unpredictability. Reframe 'accidents' as 'happy surprises' — watercolor's unpredictability is part of its beauty. The key tips: use enough water (most beginners use too little), work on a slight angle, and do not go back to touch up a wet wash (it creates blooms and back-runs). Quality paper makes an enormous difference — even inexpensive watercolor paper is far better than regular paper, which buckles and pills. Tape the paper down to prevent warping.",
