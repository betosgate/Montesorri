    "description": "Students learn that adverbs modify verbs, telling HOW, WHEN, or WHERE an action happens. They use the Montessori grammar symbol for adverbs (orange circle) and practice identifying and using adverbs in sentences.",
    "instructions": "1. Review verbs and adjectives with grammar symbols.\n2. Introduce adverbs: words that modify verbs.\n3. Present the Montessori grammar symbol for adverbs (small orange circle).\n4. Demonstrate: 'She ran' vs. 'She ran quickly.' The adverb tells HOW she ran.\n5. Explore three types: how (quickly, softly), when (yesterday, soon), where (here, outside).\n6. Play the adverb game: act out verbs with different adverbs.\n7. Write sentences with adverbs.",

It's not like cleaning your room work, but more like using your muscles to push or pull something so it moves. Lifting a heavy toy or pushing a chair across the floor – that's work!

Here, monks spent years copying books by hand: the Bible, ancient Greek and Roman texts, medical knowledge, farming guides. Without these monks, the writings of Aristotle, Plato, and many others would have been LOST FOREVER.",
          "mascot_explanation": "Now we're looking at a very special room called the scriptorium! This was like the most important library and copy shop all rolled into one.

That's where the rope or string fits perfectly. You know how you pull a rope on a flagpole to make the flag go up? That's a pulley!

Each knight's shield bore a unique COAT OF ARMS to identify them in battle.",

We need a big open space where we can move around, like your living room or outside if it's nice. Then, we need music with a good beat, maybe some old-sounding music or just something catchy! You'll also want a notebook and pencil to write down the dance moves, and comfy shoes or just go barefoot so you can dance freely.",

There were no dance studios or lessons — people learned by joining in. Folk dances were simple patterns that anyone could follow.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This slide is telling us that back in medieval times, almost everyone danced for all sorts of reasons – like after harvesting crops or at big parties like weddings. They didn't have special teachers; people just learned the dances by watching and joining in, so it was a way for everyone in the community to have fun together.",

          "mascot_explanation": "Now we're going to learn a fun circle dance! Imagine you're all holding hands in a big circle, and you'll take two steps to the right, then one step to the left, and then kick your left foot out. Then you do the opposite: two steps to the left, one step to the right, and kick your right foot out. We’ll do this over and over, moving around the circle like a happy dance parade!",

You've just practiced medieval dances and even made up your own, which means you totally get how dancing has always been a way for people to connect and have fun together.

    "parent_notes": "Folk dancing connects movement, music, history, and community. The more family members who participate, the more authentic and fun it becomes. Do not worry about perfection — the point is joyful movement! The dance patterns develop rhythm awareness, coordination, and spatial awareness. Medieval folk music is available on YouTube and streaming services. If your child enjoys this, explore folk dances from other cultures: Mexican folk dance, Irish step dance, or Indian classical dance. The choreography exercise develops sequencing and creative expression.",
