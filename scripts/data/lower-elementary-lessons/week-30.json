    "instructions": "1. Discuss: What does it mean to PERSUADE someone? (Convince them to agree with you or take action.)\n2. Explain the difference between FACT (can be proven) and OPINION (what someone believes).\n3. Practice: Is this a fact or opinion? 'Dogs are mammals' (fact). 'Dogs are the best pets' (opinion).\n4. Strong persuasive writing: clear opinion statement, 3 supporting reasons, evidence or examples for each, a call to action.\n5. Model writing a persuasive paragraph: 'Schools should have longer recess because...'\n6. Discuss audience: Who are you trying to convince? What would matter to THEM?\n7. Child chooses an opinion topic and writes a persuasive paragraph with 3 reasons.\n8. Share and discuss: Were the reasons convincing?",

Finding the pulse is a hands-on highlight; help the child find it at the wrist (radial artery) and neck (carotid artery). Veins visible through the skin provide a real anatomy observation. The capillary concept is important: these microscopic vessels are where the actual work of circulation happens — delivering oxygen and nutrients to cells. The body outline drawing activity creates a reference the child will keep. Connect to health: exercise strengthens the heart and improves circulation; a healthy diet keeps blood vessels clear.",

Just remember to keep it all feeling like it's from that time.",

The tea-aging technique is optional but produces spectacular results and children love it (brush strong tea onto paper with a sponge, let dry, then write and draw). Display the finished newspaper prominently — it represents mastery across multiple subjects. The project also teaches media literacy: news has always been a constructed product, shaped by the writer's perspective and choices. What does the editor choose to include? What is left out? These are important questions for modern media consumers too.",
