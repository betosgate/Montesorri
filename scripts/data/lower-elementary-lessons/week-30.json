The proportions matter: plasma is the majority (use more syrup), red blood cells are very numerous (many red candies), white blood cells are fewer (just a few marshmallows), and platelets are tiny and numerous (sprinkles). The iron-in-hemoglobin connection to blood's red color is a great chemistry fact. Blood types (A, B, AB, O) can be briefly mentioned as a fun fact — many children want to know their type. The week-long circulatory system study has built a comprehensive understanding: heart, vessels, and blood.

    "parent_notes": "This culminating project is one of the most satisfying of the year because it integrates so many skills: history content, persuasive writing, informational writing, art, and design. The tea-aging technique is optional but produces spectacular results and children love it (brush strong tea onto paper with a sponge, let dry, then write and draw). Display the finished newspaper prominently — it represents mastery across multiple subjects. The project also teaches media literacy: news has always been a constructed product, shaped by the writer's perspective and choices. What does the editor choose to include? What is left out? These are important questions for modern media consumers too.",
