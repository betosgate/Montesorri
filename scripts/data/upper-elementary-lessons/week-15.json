    "description": "Students learn systematic revision strategies to strengthen their narrative drafts. They focus on show-don't-tell techniques, eliminating weak verbs, tightening prose, and ensuring story elements work together cohesively.",
    "instructions": "1. Distinguish revision (big changes) from editing (surface corrections).\n2. Read aloud technique: listen for awkward phrasing and pacing issues.\n3. Show don't tell: convert telling sentences to showing scenes.\n4. Strong verb replacement: eliminate 'was,' 'went,' 'said' with vivid alternatives.\n5. Sentence variety: mix short punchy sentences with longer descriptive ones.\n6. Check story arc: does the conflict build? Is the resolution satisfying?\n7. Students revise their narrative drafts using a revision checklist.\n8. Peer conference: exchange stories and provide structured feedback.",

If you know the diameter (d), you can multiply it by Pi (π) to get the circumference (C): C = πd. Or, since the diameter is twice the radius (r), you can use C = 2πr.

While he was locked up, he told his stories to someone who wrote them all down in a book.

This slide shows us that \"ough\" can sound totally different depending on the word – like in \"through\" it sounds like \"oo,\" but in \"tough\" it sounds like \"uff.\" It's wild, right?

DEFORESTATION destroys habitats for agriculture and development — we lose about 10 million hectares of forest per year. POLLUTION contaminates water, air, and soil. OVERFISHING depletes ocean fish populations faster than they can reproduce. These impacts cascade through food webs, affecting species far beyond the ones directly harmed.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This step is talking about how humans can accidentally mess things up in nature. Things like cutting down too many trees for farms or buildings, which is called deforestation, or putting trash and chemicals into our water and air, which is pollution. We also take too many fish out of the ocean, so the fish can't reproduce fast enough. All these actions can really harm the animals and plants that live there.",

CLIMATE CHANGE amplifies everything: rising temperatures shift biomes, melt ice, raise sea levels, and alter rainfall patterns faster than many species can adapt.",
          "mascot_explanation": "Here we're learning about how building roads or houses can break up animal homes into smaller pieces, making it hard for them to find food or mates, and this is called habitat fragmentation. On top of that, climate change, which is caused by things like pollution, is making the planet warmer and changing weather patterns, making it tough for many plants and animals to survive.
