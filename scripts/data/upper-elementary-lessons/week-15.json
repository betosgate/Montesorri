    "description": "Students learn systematic revision strategies to strengthen their narrative drafts. They focus on show-don't-tell techniques, eliminating weak verbs, tightening prose, and ensuring story elements work together cohesively.",
    "instructions": "1. Distinguish revision (big changes) from editing (surface corrections).\n2. Read aloud technique: listen for awkward phrasing and pacing issues.\n3. Show don't tell: convert telling sentences to showing scenes.\n4. Strong verb replacement: eliminate 'was,' 'went,' 'said' with vivid alternatives.\n5. Sentence variety: mix short punchy sentences with longer descriptive ones.\n6. Check story arc: does the conflict build? Is the resolution satisfying?\n7. Students revise their narrative drafts using a revision checklist.\n8. Peer conference: exchange stories and provide structured feedback.",
