Practice the 'five-finger test' for reading level: hold up one finger for each unfamiliar word per page.\n4. Discuss how to push beyond comfort zones while still enjoying reading.\n5. Explore at least one genre the student has not tried this year: science fiction, biography, historical fiction, graphic novel, or poetry collection.\n6. Create a realistic summer reading schedule: when, where, and how long each day.\n7. Discuss reading environments: quiet time, audiobooks for car rides, reading before bed.\n8. Write a short 'Reading Contract' committing to the schedule.\n9. Practice writing a recommendation paragraph that would convince a friend to read a book.\n10.

          "mascot_explanation": "Here's a super useful trick called the \"five-finger test\" to figure out if a book is a good fit for you. As you read a page, count how many words you don't know and hold up a finger for each one. If it's zero or one finger, it's probably easy peasy; two or three fingers means it's just right; and four or five might mean it's a bit tough, so maybe have another book ready just in case.",

It's called \"Creative Self-Portrait,\" and the subtitle tells us the main idea: we're going to make art that shows not just what we look like, but who we really are inside. Think of it as making a picture that tells your story.",

The mirror is so you can see your face, but remember, we're going beyond just looks! Your sketchbook is for planning, the examples show cool ways artists have done this before, and the artist's statement template is where you'll write about your masterpiece.",

          "mascot_explanation": "So, this step is about understanding what a self-portrait can be. Artists for hundreds of years have made pictures of themselves, and it wasn't just about looking in a mirror. They used their art to show their feelings, their background, or what was important to them, like Frida Kahlo did with symbols. Your portrait should do the same – show your unique personality.",

What do you believe in? What are your biggest dreams? Think about your favorite things, your personality, and how you can show all of that in your picture.",

          "mascot_explanation": "This is where you get to be the artist and decide *how* you want to make your portrait. Will it look super realistic with maybe some special symbols added in? Or maybe more like an abstract painting where colors and shapes show your feelings? You could even make a collage with pictures and words. There's no single right way, so pick what feels cool to you.",

This self-portrait is like a snapshot of who you are right now – all your unique interests, your dreams, and your own artistic style are captured in this one piece.

Introduce planner use: writing down assignments, due dates, and breaking large projects into smaller tasks.\n3. Practice using a planner with a simulated week of middle school assignments.\n4. Discuss learning styles: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, reading/writing — most people are a mix.\n5. Help students identify their own learning preferences.\n6. Introduce study strategies: flashcards, summarizing, teaching others, practice problems, graphic organizers.\n7. Practice the Pomodoro technique: 25 minutes of focused work, 5-minute break.\n8. Discuss managing distractions: phone, TV, noise.\n9. Create a 'My Study System' personal reference guide.\n10. Role-play: manage a busy week with multiple assignments due on different days.",

The big idea here is to write down *every single thing* you need to do the second you get it, especially the due date.
