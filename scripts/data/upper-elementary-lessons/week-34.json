Practice the 'five-finger test' for reading level: hold up one finger for each unfamiliar word per page.\n4. Discuss how to push beyond comfort zones while still enjoying reading.\n5. Explore at least one genre the student has not tried this year: science fiction, biography, historical fiction, graphic novel, or poetry collection.\n6. Create a realistic summer reading schedule: when, where, and how long each day.\n7. Discuss reading environments: quiet time, audiobooks for car rides, reading before bed.\n8. Write a short 'Reading Contract' committing to the schedule.\n9. Practice writing a recommendation paragraph that would convince a friend to read a book.\n10.
