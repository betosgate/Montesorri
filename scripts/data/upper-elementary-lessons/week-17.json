    "instructions": "1. Introduce Michelangelo as sculptor, painter, architect, and poet.\n2. Study the Sistine Chapel ceiling: scale, composition, and narrative.\n3. Examine the sculpture of David: proportion, contrapposto, emotion.\n4. Discuss Michelangelo's study of anatomy for artistic accuracy.\n5. Introduce basic figure proportions (the body is 7-8 heads tall).\n6. Practice proportional figure sketching.",

        {"type": "instruction", "step": 1, "text": "Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564) believed the human body was the most beautiful thing God created. He spent years studying anatomy — even dissecting cadavers — to understand exactly how muscles, bones, and skin work together. This knowledge shows in every figure he painted and sculpted. His humans are not just accurate; they are heroic, powerful, and emotionally alive."},
        {"type": "instruction", "step": 2, "text": "The Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508-1512) covers over 5,000 square feet and contains 343 figures. Michelangelo painted it largely alone, lying on his back on scaffolding for four years. The most famous panel, The Creation of Adam, shows God reaching toward Adam with nearly touching fingers. The composition creates incredible tension — the gap between their fingers is one of the most recognizable images in all of art."},
        {"type": "instruction", "step": 3, "text": "The David (1501-1504) stands 17 feet tall, carved from a single block of marble. Notice the contrapposto pose — David's weight is on one leg, creating a natural, relaxed stance with subtle tension. His oversized hands and intense gaze show a young man preparing to face Goliath. Michelangelo chose to depict the moment before the fight, not after — the moment of courage, not victory. Every artistic choice tells the story."},
        {"type": "instruction", "step": 4, "text": "Figure proportions: The human body is approximately 7-8 heads tall (head height is the unit of measurement). The center of the body is roughly at the hips. Arms reach to mid-thigh. The shoulders are about 2-3 head-widths across. These proportions help artists draw realistic figures. Michelangelo often exaggerated proportions slightly — making hands and torsos larger — to create a sense of heroic power."},
        {"type": "activity", "prompt": "Practice proportional figure drawing. (1) Draw a vertical line and divide it into 8 equal sections (each representing one head-height). Sketch a standing figure using these proportions: head in section 1, chest/torso in sections 2-3, hips at section 4, legs in sections 5-8. (2) Try a contrapposto pose: weight on one leg, opposite shoulder slightly raised. (3) Study the Creation of Adam and sketch just the two hands reaching toward each other, paying attention to the finger positions and the space between them.", "duration_minutes": 25},
        {"type": "wrap_up", "text": "Michelangelo showed the world what the human form could become in art: powerful, emotional, and heroic. His anatomical knowledge made his art truthful, and his artistic vision made it transcendent. The proportional drawing skills you practiced today are the same principles artists have used for 500 years. Keep practicing — Michelangelo himself said, 'If people knew how hard I worked to get my mastery, it would not seem so wonderful at all.'", "mastery_check": "Can the student use proportional guidelines to draw a basic human figure? Can they describe contrapposto and explain how Michelangelo's anatomical knowledge improved his art?"}

    "parent_notes": "Figure drawing is challenging but rewarding. The proportional guidelines (8 heads tall) give students a framework that prevents the common 'big head, small body' problem. Encourage your child to practice drawing figures from reference photos, not from imagination — observation is key. The contrapposto pose appears everywhere in art and even in photography; once your child recognizes it, they will see it in advertisements, statues, and movie poses. Michelangelo's dedication (four years on his back painting the Sistine Chapel) is an inspiring model of persistence. If your child is frustrated with figure drawing, remind them of Michelangelo's own words about hard work.",
