It shows you that you can write this comparison in three ways – like 12 to 8, 12:8, or even as a fraction 12/8 – and they all mean the same thing. We'll also learn how to make these numbers smaller, like simplifying 12:8 down to 3:2, so it's easier to see the relationship."

          "mascot_explanation": "So, a rate is like a special kind of ratio where you're comparing things that are measured differently, like miles and hours for speed, or dollars and pounds for shopping prices.

          "mascot_explanation": "This slide shows us why these ratios and rates are so important for understanding the world.
