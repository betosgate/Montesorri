    "description": "Students explore how natural resources shape economic activity around the world. They learn about renewable and nonrenewable resources, map major resource-producing regions, and analyze how resource distribution affects wealth and power.",
    "instructions": "1. Define natural resources: materials from the Earth that people use.\n2. Renewable vs. nonrenewable resources.\n3. Major resource categories: minerals, fossil fuels, water, forests, soil.\n4. Map where key resources are found: oil (Middle East, Russia), minerals (Africa, Australia).\n5. Discuss how resources shape economies: oil-rich nations, mining economies.\n6. The 'resource curse': why resource-rich countries are not always wealthy.\n7. Students create an economic resource map.\n8. Discuss sustainability: Can we use resources without depleting them?",

They are not evenly distributed — some countries are resource-rich while others have very few. This uneven distribution shapes global economics, politics, and even wars.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This step is all about defining what natural resources are. Basically, they're anything from the Earth that we use – like metals, oil, water, or even the dirt we grow food in. The big idea here is that these resources aren't spread out evenly everywhere, and that's a huge reason why some countries are super rich and powerful, and others aren't."

NONRENEWABLE resources exist in fixed amounts and will eventually run out: fossil fuels (oil, coal, natural gas), minerals (gold, iron, copper, rare earth elements). Our economy depends heavily on nonrenewable resources.",
          "mascot_explanation": "Now we're looking at two main types of resources: renewable and nonrenewable. Renewable ones, like sunshine or wind, can basically be used over and over without running out, or they grow back, like trees if we're careful. Nonrenewable ones, like oil or gold, are like a limited supply – once we use them up, they're gone forever, and we use a lot of those!"

These resources shape trade, alliances, and conflicts.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This slide shows us how important certain resources are and where they're found. For example, the Middle East has tons of oil, which makes it really powerful. Africa has loads of valuable minerals like diamonds and gold, and Australia is a huge producer of iron and coal. Knowing this helps us understand why countries trade with each other and sometimes even argue."

Resource wealth can lead to corruption, conflict over control, neglect of education and other industries, and economic instability when resource prices fall. Countries like Norway have avoided this through careful management.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This is a really interesting idea called the 'resource curse.' It's kind of weird, but sometimes countries that have tons of natural resources end up being poorer and having more problems, like corruption or fighting, than countries with fewer resources. This happens because it can cause conflict over who controls the wealth, and sometimes governments don't focus on other important things like schools."

You'll use symbols like black dots for oil and yellow for gold to mark where these resources are found. Then, make a key so you know what each symbol means. You'll also need to find out which countries produce the most oil, gold, and iron, and then write a short paragraph explaining why all this matters for understanding world events, giving a couple of examples."

    "parent_notes": "Musical composition is creative expression through sound. Even simple melodies are valid compositions. The A-B-A form provides structure while allowing creativity. Encourage your child to experiment — there are no wrong notes in a first draft, just like there are no wrong words in a first draft. If the composition sounds good to your child, it IS good. Performing for family members builds confidence and communication. Consider recording the performance as a keepsake. If your child enjoys composing, encourage them to continue creating new pieces.",
