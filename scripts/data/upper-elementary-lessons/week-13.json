    "description": "Students revise their persuasive essay from last week, focusing on strengthening arguments, improving transitions, refining word choice, and polishing mechanics. They produce a final draft that represents their best persuasive writing.",
    "instructions": "1. Read the first draft aloud — listening catches errors eyes miss.\n2. Evaluate against the rubric: claim clarity, evidence quality, counterargument strength, conclusion power.\n3. Check transitions between paragraphs — are ideas connected smoothly?\n4. Strengthen word choice: replace vague words with specific, powerful ones.\n5. Check sentence variety — is there a mix of simple, compound, complex?\n6. Edit for mechanics: spelling, punctuation, grammar.\n7. Write the final draft.\n8. Read the final draft aloud one more time.",

When you hear your words, you'll catch mistakes your eyes might have skipped over, kind of like how you can hear a squeaky door but might not see the loose hinge.

Think about connecting your ideas between paragraphs with words like \"also\" or \"however\" so the reader doesn't get lost.

It meant that if someone was basically forced to work for a lord (called a serf), they could escape and become free just by living in a town for a year. Towns also got special permission slips called \"charters\" from kings, which let them make their own rules instead of listening to a lord, which was a huge deal.",

Teach the format: sender address, date, recipient address, salutation, body, closing, signature.\n3. Compare formal tone vs. informal tone.\n4. Discuss appropriate salutations: Dear Mr./Ms./Dr., To Whom It May Concern.\n5. Practice different letter types: request, opinion, complaint, thank-you.\n6.

Area is measured in SQUARE units (cm², m², ft²).",

Area is all the space *inside* the shape, like how much carpet you'd need to cover a floor.

TROUBADOURS were poet-musicians in southern France (1100s-1300s) who composed and performed songs about love, adventure, politics, and nature. They traveled from castle to castle, entertaining nobles. Similar musicians in northern France were called trouveres, and in Germany, minnesingers.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This step explains that while church music was serious and in Latin, troubadours were travelling musicians from places like southern France who sang in everyday language about things like love, exciting journeys, and even what was happening in politics.

They were the pop stars of their era.",
          "mascot_explanation": "So, these troubadour songs were \"secular,\" meaning they weren't about religion, and they were often about this super idealized kind of love called \"courtly love,\" which is like having a huge crush on someone famous or way out of your league.

          "mascot_explanation": "Alright, this slide is giving us the blueprint for writing our own song, like a recipe for a hit!

          "mascot_explanation": "This step is showing us the magic of suffixes – they're like secret codes you add to the end of a word to change its job. For example, if you take the word \"educate,\" which is something you *do*, and add \"-ion,\" you get \"education,\" which is the *thing* you do.

          "mascot_explanation": "Now we're focusing on suffixes that turn words into nouns, which are usually people, places, or things.

It's the straight up-and-down distance from the top side to the bottom side, forming a right angle, like the corner of a square.

You have studied: compound and complex sentences, subordinating and coordinating conjunctions, prepositions, Greek and Latin roots, prefixes and suffixes, spelling patterns, persuasive writing, book reviews, formal letters, context clues, and vocabulary building. That is an impressive list!",
          "mascot_explanation": "This slide is like a high-five for everything you've tackled in the last month.

          "mascot_explanation": "Alright, time for a quick grammar check! We need to figure out what kind of sentences these are.

Biotic means living things – plants, bugs, anything that eats or grows – while abiotic means nonliving things like sunshine, rocks, and the air we breathe.

    "parent_notes": "Gothic architecture combines art, engineering, and history beautifully. The drawing techniques (compass for arches and rose windows, ruler for straight lines) teach precision and geometric thinking. The compass skills connect to math geometry lessons. If possible, take a virtual tour of a Gothic cathedral — many offer 360-degree online experiences. The fact that these buildings took generations to complete is a powerful lesson about long-term thinking, dedication, and working toward something bigger than yourself.",
