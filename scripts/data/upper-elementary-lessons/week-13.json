The drawing techniques (compass for arches and rose windows, ruler for straight lines) teach precision and geometric thinking. The compass skills connect to math geometry lessons. If possible, take a virtual tour of a Gothic cathedral — many offer 360-degree online experiences. The fact that these buildings took generations to complete is a powerful lesson about long-term thinking, dedication, and working toward something bigger than yourself.",
