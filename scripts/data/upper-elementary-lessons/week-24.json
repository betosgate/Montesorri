If your child is nervous about performing, remind them that every professional musician started exactly where they are now. Consider hosting a mini-concert for family members — even a brief performance builds confidence enormously. The fusion piece (combining West African and Latin elements) is a creative challenge that mirrors how real musical genres develop through cultural exchange.",
