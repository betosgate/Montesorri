The reason we only need to cross out multiples of 2, 3, 5, and 7 is that any composite number up to 100 *must* have one of those primes as a factor. For example, if you have a composite number like 35, it's made of 5 times 7, and both 5 and 7 are on our list.

Imagine, about 4,000 years ago, people in a place called Mesopotamia were telling and writing down this tale on clay tablets.

The Robinson projection tries to make things look more balanced by curving the edges, so it's not perfect but it's pretty good overall and often used in schools.

Seals depicted gods, heroes, animals, and daily life scenes.",

The concept of reverse carving (like a rubber stamp) requires spatial reasoning and is a good cognitive challenge. If the dowel-rod method is too difficult, an alternative is to carve a design into a flat piece of clay and press it onto another piece (like a stamp rather than a rolling seal). Air-dry clay works well; let the seal dry completely before rolling it in very soft clay for the clearest impression.",

It's telling us that prime factorization, which we've already learned, isn't just some random math thing – it's a tool, like a hammer or a screwdriver, that we can use to solve problems.

          "mascot_explanation": "Okay, so this slide is like our shopping list for making music! We've got pictures of old instruments to look at, some sound clips so we can hear what they might have sounded like, and then the fun stuff to build our own: rubber bands (different sizes are important!), a box to stretch them on, some cardboard tubes for wind instruments, straws, scissors, and tape. It's also telling us how to get started, like stretching those rubber bands on the box to make a guitar-like thing or cutting straws for a flute."

          "text": "Last week we explored rhythm and percussion — the oldest music. But humans soon discovered that stretched strings and blown air could create different kinds of sounds: melody and sustained tones. These discoveries opened up a new world of musical expression. The first string instruments may have been hunting bows plucked for entertainment.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This step is reminding us about rhythm from last week, but now we're moving on to new sounds. Imagine ancient people who only knew drumming, and then they discovered that if they plucked a stretched string, like on a hunting bow, it made a different kind of sound – not just a beat, but a musical note! This was a huge deal because it meant they could make melodies, not just rhythms."

          "text": "The LYRE was the iconic instrument of the ancient world. Mesopotamian lyres from the Royal Tombs of Ur (2500 BCE) are magnificently decorated with gold and gemstones — clearly, music was important to these people. The Greek god Apollo was depicted playing a lyre. Lyres have strings of different lengths stretched over a frame. Shorter strings produce higher notes, longer strings produce lower notes.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This slide introduces the LYRE, which was a super fancy instrument back in ancient times, kind of like a small harp or guitar. Some of them were decorated with gold and jewels, showing how important music was to people in places like Mesopotamia and Greece. The slide explains that different lengths of strings make different notes – shorter ones make higher sounds, and longer ones make lower sounds, just like on a guitar."

          "text": "The Egyptian HARP was larger and had more strings, allowing for more complex melodies. Tomb paintings show harpists performing for pharaohs and at religious ceremonies. Wind instruments appeared very early: bone flutes from 40,000 years ago have been found in caves. The Greek AULOS was a double-reed instrument (like a double oboe) played at festivals, athletic games, and ceremonies.",
          "mascot_explanation": "Now we're looking at more instruments! The Egyptian HARP was bigger and had more strings than the lyre, so musicians could play more complicated songs. They also found really old bone flutes, like, *really* old – 40,000 years old! And then there's the AULOS from Greece, which was like playing two flutes at once, and people used it for celebrations and games."

          "text": "The science of music: String instruments work because plucking a string makes it vibrate. The pitch depends on three things: length (shorter = higher), thickness (thinner = higher), and tension (tighter = higher). Wind instruments work because blowing creates vibrations in a column of air. The pitch depends on the length of the air column (shorter tube = higher pitch). Music is physics made audible.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This is where we get a little bit science-y with our music! It explains *why* instruments make sound. For string instruments, it's all about vibrations – when you pluck a string, it wiggles super fast, and that's the sound. The slide tells us that shorter, thinner, or tighter strings make higher notes. For wind instruments, it's the air inside that vibrates, and a shorter tube means the air vibrates faster, making a higher sound."

The thinner bands will produce higher notes, thicker ones lower notes. Pluck them to hear the difference. Can you play a simple melody? (2) STRAW PAN FLUTE: Cut 5-8 straws to different lengths (each about 1 cm shorter than the last). Tape them side by side in order from longest to shortest. Blow across the tops — each straw produces a different note. Try to play a simple tune. Experiment: What happens when you make a straw shorter? What does this tell you about pitch?",

          "mascot_explanation": "Alright, it's time to get creative and build something! You can either make a \"Box Lyre\" by stretching rubber bands around a shoe box – experiment with the different band thicknesses to hear how they change the sound. Or, you can build a \"Straw Pan Flute\" by taping straws of different lengths together and blowing across the tops. Try playing a simple tune and see how changing the length of the straw or the rubber band affects the note."

It's reminding us that even though ancient people didn't have science books, they figured out the basic ideas of music – like how vibrations and different lengths make different sounds. When you play the instrument you just built, you're connecting with people from thousands of years ago who were doing the same thing, making music."

The box lyre is especially effective — children can feel the vibrations and hear how different thicknesses produce different pitches. The straw pan flute demonstrates the relationship between air column length and pitch. If your child enjoys this, explore the physics of sound further: Why do shorter strings and shorter tubes make higher sounds? (Shorter = faster vibration = higher frequency = higher pitch.) If you search for 'reconstructed ancient lyre' or 'ancient Greek aulos' on YouTube, you can hear what these instruments actually sounded like.",
