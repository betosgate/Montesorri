    "description": "Students explore ancient string and wind instruments from Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece. They learn about the lyre, harp, aulos, and flute, discover how ancient peoples made music from natural materials, and experiment with creating simple instruments.",
    "instructions": "1. Review percussion and rhythm from week 1.\n2. Introduce ancient string instruments: the lyre (Mesopotamia/Greece), the harp (Egypt).\n3. Introduce ancient wind instruments: bone flutes, the aulos (Greek double flute).\n4. Listen to reconstructed sounds of ancient instruments.\n5. Discuss the role of music in ancient societies.\n6. Create a simple string or wind instrument from household materials.",

        {"type": "instruction", "step": 1, "text": "Last week we explored rhythm and percussion — the oldest music. But humans soon discovered that stretched strings and blown air could create different kinds of sounds: melody and sustained tones. These discoveries opened up a new world of musical expression. The first string instruments may have been hunting bows plucked for entertainment."},
        {"type": "instruction", "step": 2, "text": "The LYRE was the iconic instrument of the ancient world. Mesopotamian lyres from the Royal Tombs of Ur (2500 BCE) are magnificently decorated with gold and gemstones — clearly, music was important to these people. The Greek god Apollo was depicted playing a lyre. Lyres have strings of different lengths stretched over a frame. Shorter strings produce higher notes, longer strings produce lower notes."},
        {"type": "instruction", "step": 3, "text": "The Egyptian HARP was larger and had more strings, allowing for more complex melodies. Tomb paintings show harpists performing for pharaohs and at religious ceremonies. Wind instruments appeared very early: bone flutes from 40,000 years ago have been found in caves. The Greek AULOS was a double-reed instrument (like a double oboe) played at festivals, athletic games, and ceremonies."},
        {"type": "instruction", "step": 4, "text": "The science of music: String instruments work because plucking a string makes it vibrate. The pitch depends on three things: length (shorter = higher), thickness (thinner = higher), and tension (tighter = higher). Wind instruments work because blowing creates vibrations in a column of air. The pitch depends on the length of the air column (shorter tube = higher pitch). Music is physics made audible."},
        {"type": "activity", "prompt": "Build one or both simple instruments: (1) BOX LYRE: Stretch 4-5 rubber bands of different thicknesses around an open shoe box. The thinner bands will produce higher notes, thicker ones lower notes. Pluck them to hear the difference. Can you play a simple melody? (2) STRAW PAN FLUTE: Cut 5-8 straws to different lengths (each about 1 cm shorter than the last). Tape them side by side in order from longest to shortest. Blow across the tops — each straw produces a different note. Try to play a simple tune. Experiment: What happens when you make a straw shorter? What does this tell you about pitch?", "duration_minutes": 25},
        {"type": "wrap_up", "text": "From drums to strings to winds, ancient peoples discovered the fundamental principles of music — vibration, pitch, and rhythm — thousands of years before the science behind them was understood. When you pluck your box lyre, you are doing what a musician in Ur did 4,500 years ago. Music connects us across time.", "mastery_check": "Can the student describe ancient string and wind instruments, explain the relationship between string/tube length and pitch, and create a simple instrument that demonstrates this principle?"}

    },
    "parent_notes": "The instrument-building activity integrates science (sound, vibration, pitch) with music and history. The box lyre is especially effective — children can feel the vibrations and hear how different thicknesses produce different pitches. The straw pan flute demonstrates the relationship between air column length and pitch. If your child enjoys this, explore the physics of sound further: Why do shorter strings and shorter tubes make higher sounds? (Shorter = faster vibration = higher frequency = higher pitch.) If you search for 'reconstructed ancient lyre' or 'ancient Greek aulos' on YouTube, you can hear what these instruments actually sounded like.",
