Secondary sources interpret or analyze primary sources: a textbook chapter, an encyclopedia article, a documentary. Both are valuable, but they serve different purposes.",
          "mascot_explanation": "Now, let's talk about different kinds of information. Primary sources are like hearing directly from someone who was there – think of a diary entry or an old photo.

          "mascot_explanation": "This is where we learn our secret weapon: the CRAAP test!

Which would you trust most for a research report, and why?",
          "mascot_explanation": "Time to put the CRAAP test to work! We've got three different sources about volcanoes. Imagine you need to write a report: one is a news article by a reporter, one is a blog with no author, and the last is an encyclopedia entry checked by experts.

The millions period has millions, ten-millions, hundred-millions. Each place is 10 times the place to its right.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This step is all about how numbers are organized. Imagine numbers are like houses on a street, and they're grouped into neighborhoods called \"periods.\" We have the ones neighborhood (ones, tens, hundreds), then the thousands neighborhood (thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands), and then the millions neighborhood (millions, ten millions, hundred millions).

          "mascot_explanation": "Now we get to actually read these giant numbers! It's like reading a story, but we pause at the end of each neighborhood (period). So, for a number like 45,328,716, we read it as \"forty-five million, three hundred twenty-eight thousand, seven hundred sixteen.\" We say the neighborhood name (million, thousand) after each group, but we skip it for the very first neighborhood, the ones.",

          "mascot_explanation": "This slide shows us three different ways to write the same big number. \"Standard form\" is just the way we usually write numbers, like 7,230,500. \"Expanded form\" breaks it down to show what each digit is worth, like 7,000,000 + 200,000 + 30,000 + 500. \"Word form\" is writing it out with words, just like we learned in the last step: seven million, two hundred thirty thousand, five hundred.

          "mascot_explanation": "Here, we're looking at the actual steps of the scientific method. First, you notice something interesting and ask a question about it.

          "mascot_explanation": "This slide is super important because it helps us understand what makes a good science question. You can't test everything, like \"Is blue the best color?\" because that's just an opinion.

          "mascot_explanation": "This slide is showing us a visual way to understand what we just did, called the \"area model.\" Imagine drawing a big rectangle and splitting it into four smaller boxes based on the numbers we're multiplying (like 40 and 5 for 45, and 20 and 3 for 23).

          "mascot_explanation": "This part explains that way, way back, around 3500 BCE, people in a place called Sumer started building the very first real cities.

Yes, 8 times (8x3=24). Write 8 above the 4. Subtract: 24-24=0. Step 3: Bring down the 7. Does 3 go into 7? Yes, 2 times (2x3=6). Write 2 above the 7. Subtract: 7-6=1. Answer: 282 remainder 1.",

Then we multiply 2 times 3 to get 6, and subtract that from 8, which leaves us with 2. Now we 'bring down' the next digit, the 4, to make 24. We repeat the process: 'Does 3 go into 24?' It goes in 8 times, so we write the 8 up top. Multiply 8 by 3 to get 24, and subtract that from 24, which is 0. Finally, we bring down the 7. 'Does 3 go into 7?' It goes in 2 times, so we write the 2 up top. Multiply 2 by 3 to get 6, and subtract that from 7, leaving us with 1. So, our answer is 282 with a remainder of 1.",
