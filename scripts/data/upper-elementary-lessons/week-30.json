Guide students to locate at least three new sources for their capstone topic.\n6. Practice note-taking using the Cornell method: main ideas on the right, key words on the left, summary at the bottom.\n7. Demonstrate how to paraphrase effectively without plagiarizing.\n8. Students create source cards with bibliographic information for each source.\n9. Organize notes by subtopic, matching them to the outline sections.\n10.
