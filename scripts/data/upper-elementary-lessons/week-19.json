The traditional narrative of 'brave explorers discovering new worlds' has been rightly challenged by historians who center indigenous perspectives.

History is not about heroes and villains but about understanding how and why events happened. The perspective-writing activity is crucial: being able to see the same event from different viewpoints is the foundation of historical thinking and, more broadly, of empathy. The connection to the Columbian Exchange lesson (disease as the primary factor) reinforces the science curriculum.",

Cooking together after this lesson becomes a chemistry lab: talk about what is happening chemically when bread rises, meat browns, or eggs solidify. The photosynthesis/respiration connection is profound: every breath you take is a chemical reaction that is the mirror image of what plants do. This connects to geography (the carbon cycle) and history (understanding that pre-industrial civilizations were powered by photosynthesis through agriculture).",
