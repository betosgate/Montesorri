        {"type": "instruction", "step": 2, "text": "Performance mindset: Focus on the MUSIC, not on being watched. Listen to each other. Watch the director. If someone makes a mistake, keep going — the audience will not notice unless you stop. Commit to every note. Enjoy the experience — your enjoyment is contagious."},

This quarter you learned to play polyrhythms, maintain your part in an ensemble, compose with the pentatonic scale, arrange multi-section pieces, and perform for an audience. That is extraordinary growth."},

(2) Brief pep talk: Remember to listen, watch the director, and have fun. (3) Perform the complete set: West African piece, Latin American piece, pentatonic melody piece, and fusion finale. (4) Take a bow. (5) In your music journal, write a reflection: What was your favorite moment of the performance? What was most challenging? What are you most proud of? How has your understanding of music changed this quarter?", "duration_minutes": 25},

The world needs your music.", "mastery_check": "Can the student perform as part of an ensemble with rhythmic accuracy, dynamic sensitivity, and stage presence, and reflect meaningfully on their musical growth?"}

    "parent_notes": "The final performance is a milestone that deserves celebration. Attend if at all possible — your presence in the audience matters enormously to your child. Record the performance for later viewing. After the show, offer specific praise: 'I noticed how you kept the rhythm steady during the fast section' rather than generic 'Good job.' The reflection activity helps children internalize their growth. This quarter's music journey — from basic rhythms to ensemble performance — demonstrates that sustained practice and collaboration produce beautiful results. Consider continuing musical exploration during the break between quarters.",
