Discuss feature article structure: hook, nut graph, body with anecdotes and data, kicker ending.\n4. Introduce the 'nut graph' — the paragraph that tells the reader why this story matters NOW.\n5. Model integrating research sources into journalistic writing.\n6. Discuss writing for audience: adjust tone, vocabulary, and detail for your reader.\n7. Students choose a topic and begin drafting their feature article.\n8. Practice including direct quotes from sources.\n9. Peer review focusing on engagement and information balance.\n10.

          "text": "A feature article goes deeper than news. While a news article reports WHAT happened, a feature explores WHY it matters, HOW it affects people, and WHAT it means. Features use storytelling techniques — anecdotes, vivid details, and compelling characters — alongside facts and data.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This step is all about understanding what makes a feature article different from a regular news report. While news just tells you the facts, a feature article pulls you in with stories, details, and explanations about *why* something is important and how it affects us. It’s like the difference between someone just telling you it rained, and someone telling you about the beautiful rainbow that appeared after the rain and how it made their day.",

BODY — alternating between anecdotes/stories and data/analysis. KICKER — a memorable ending that resonates.",
          "mascot_explanation": "Here's a look at the building blocks of a great feature article. You start with a \"hook\" to grab the reader's attention, like a cool story or a surprising fact. Then comes the \"nut graph,\" which is super important because it tells everyone why they should keep reading. The \"body\" is where you mix in more stories and interesting facts, and finally, the \"kicker\" is a strong ending that leaves a lasting impression.",

Example: After a hook about a grandmother using GPS to find her way, the nut graph might say: 'GPS technology, born in the Cold War space race, now guides 4 billion smartphone users daily.'",
          "mascot_explanation": "This slide focuses on the \"nut graph,\" which is like the heart of your article. It’s the paragraph that answers the reader's question: \"Why should I spend my time reading this?\" For example, if you started with a fun story about a dog learning a new trick, the nut graph would explain how that trick relates to bigger things like animal training science or even how pets help people.",

          "mascot_explanation": "This is a really key idea: you need to find the sweet spot between telling stories and sharing facts. If you only use facts, your article might sound like a textbook and put people to sleep. But if you only tell stories without any facts, it might not feel very informative. The best feature articles blend them together, like having a personal story followed by some cool data that explains it even better.",

          "mascot_explanation": "This last slide reminds us that feature writing is awesome because it teaches and entertains at the same time. You've learned how to take interesting research and turn it into a story that people will actually enjoy reading, kind of like how magazines do it. The big check is to see if you can put all those pieces together – the hook, the nut graph, the body, and the ending – and use your research to make your story shine.",

The nut graph concept — explaining why a story matters NOW — develops the skill of connecting information to relevance. If your child enjoys this, explore student journalism opportunities. Consider submitting their best feature article to a school newsletter or local publication.",

Imagine corals are like tiny animals that have little algae friends living inside them, and these algae give them food and their color.

The slide says it's mostly in the warmer parts of the ocean, between the middle of the Earth and the top or bottom.

    "instructions": "1. Review the four graph types studied this quarter: bar, line, circle, scatter plot.\n2. Discuss when each type is most appropriate.\n3. Bar graphs: comparing categories (favorite colors, species counts).\n4. Line graphs: showing change over time (temperature, population).\n5. Circle graphs: showing parts of a whole (budget allocation, time use).\n6. Scatter plots: showing relationships between two variables.\n7. Present the same data set and create different graph types from it.\n8. Discuss how the graph choice changes the message.\n9. Students create graphs for their own collected data.\n10.

          "mascot_explanation": "Now we're diving into bar graphs! Imagine you're comparing how many dogs, cats, and hamsters people own – those are separate categories, right? A bar graph is perfect for that because each bar clearly shows the count for one specific animal. If the animal names are super long, like \"Golden Retriever\" or \"Siamese Cat,\" it's often easier to make the bars go sideways so the names fit better.",

          "mascot_explanation": "This slide is all about line graphs, which are awesome for tracking things that change over time. Think about the temperature outside each day for a week – a line graph will show you if it got hotter or colder, and how quickly that change happened.

          "mascot_explanation": "This is a really important idea: the same numbers can look totally different depending on which graph you choose. A bar graph might show you each month's sales as a separate chunk, but a line graph of that same sales data would show you if sales are going up or down overall.

Editing is like putting a little polish on your photo to make it look its best – maybe making it a bit brighter or cutting out extra stuff to focus the viewer's eye.

Instead of thinking about everyone watching, try to really focus on the music itself – listen to your friends playing next to you and watch your director.

The reflection activity helps children internalize their growth.

Consider continuing musical exploration during the break between quarters.",
