Every character action is driven by motivation — desires, fears, beliefs, needs, or values. When you understand motivation, you can predict behavior, understand conflict, and connect to themes.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This step is super important because it explains that just reading what happens isn't enough; we need to understand *why* it's happening. Characters don't just do random things; they have reasons, like wanting something, being scared of something, or believing in something, and figuring that out makes the whole story make way more sense."

But if you do the multiplication first, 4 x 2 is 8, and then add 3 to get 11. See how we get two different answers?

Climate tells you what to EXPECT; weather tells you what is HAPPENING.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This step is all about understanding the difference between weather and climate. Think of weather as what you're wearing today – maybe a t-shirt because it's sunny.

The poles receive indirect sunlight at steep angles, creating cold climates. Between them are temperate zones with moderate climates and distinct seasons. This is why climate zones form roughly horizontal bands around the globe.",
          "mascot_explanation": "So, this slide explains the biggest reason why we have different climate zones: latitude, which is basically how far north or south you are from the equator. The equator gets the most direct sunshine, so it’s hot, and the North and South Poles are at crazy angles, so they're cold."

OCEAN CURRENTS — warm currents (Gulf Stream) make coastal areas warmer; cold currents (California Current) make them cooler. PROXIMITY TO WATER — water heats and cools slowly, so coastal areas have milder climates than inland areas.",
          "mascot_explanation": "Here we learn that latitude isn't the *only* thing that matters; other things can change the climate too. For example, the higher up you go in elevation, the colder it gets, like on a mountain. Also, ocean currents act like giant conveyor belts, bringing warmer or cooler water to coastlines, and being near a big body of water makes the temperature more mild."

Athens was all about thinking, creating art, and letting people have a say in how things were run. Sparta, though, was all about being tough, disciplined, and super loyal to their army.

Think about 2.3 as 23 tenths and 4.5 as 45 tenths; when you multiply them, you're also multiplying the \"tenths\" together, which makes \"hundredths.\" Since there are 100 hundredths in a whole, that's why we end up with two decimal places in our answer – we're essentially tracking those fractions!"

          "mascot_explanation": "This next strategy is called \"Spaced Practice,\" and it's like giving your brain little breaks to digest information. Instead of trying to cram everything in the night before a test, you study a little bit each day over several days. Think of it like eating a big meal slowly instead of trying to stuff it all down at once – your body (or brain!) handles it much better and remembers it longer."

It's like a mental workout for your brain, and the harder you have to think, the more you're actually learning."

This feels harder and less organized, but research shows it improves learning by forcing your brain to continually retrieve and switch between topics.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This strategy is called \"Interleaving,\" and it means mixing things up instead of doing all of one subject at once. So, instead of spending an hour on math, then an hour on science, you might do 15 minutes of math, then 15 minutes of science, then maybe 15 minutes of history.

So, the secret is to move the decimal point in the number you're dividing by (the divisor) until it becomes a whole number, and then you move the decimal point in the other number (the dividend) the exact same number of places.

Before you even start dividing, it's smart to guess what the answer might be – like, 7.56 is close to 8, and 0.12 is close to 0.1, so 8 divided by 0.1 is about 80.

Walk through any major city and you will see Greek columns, triangular pediments, and symmetrical facades on courthouses, banks, museums, and government buildings. The Greeks believed that architecture, like all art, should reflect order, harmony, and mathematical proportion.",

It's saying that if you look around at buildings like courthouses or banks, you'll see echoes of ancient Greece, and that the Greeks really cared about making their buildings look balanced and mathematically perfect."

IONIC — more elegant, with scroll-shaped capitals (called volutes). Think 'I for the curving scrolls.' CORINTHIAN — the most ornate, with capitals decorated with carved acanthus leaves. Think 'C for Curly leaves.' Each order has specific proportions: the ratio of column height to diameter differs.",
          "mascot_explanation": "Alright, this is where we meet the main stars: the three types of Greek columns! We've got the Doric, which is super simple and strong, like the foundation; the Ionic, which has these cool scroll shapes on top; and the Corinthian, which is the fanciest with carved leaves. Each one has its own special look and measurements, which is pretty neat."

It is a temple to the goddess Athena, built of white marble with Doric columns. Every dimension follows mathematical proportions. The columns are slightly curved (not perfectly straight) and lean slightly inward — optical refinements that make the building appear perfectly straight and proportioned to the human eye.",
          "mascot_explanation": "Now we're diving into the Parthenon, which was this incredible temple built super long ago in Athens. It's famous because it's almost perfectly designed, using special math and even making the columns curve just a tiny bit so they look straight to our eyes. It's considered one of the most beautiful buildings ever made."

(2) Use proper proportions — columns should be about 6 times taller than their width for Doric, 8 times for Ionic. (3) Add decorative elements in the pediment (sculpture or design).

    "parent_notes": "Greek architecture is wonderfully tangible — your child will start noticing columns everywhere. Take a walk through your town and look for Greek architectural influence: columns, pediments, symmetrical facades. Courthouses and banks are the most common locations. The ruler-drawn building design reinforces geometry skills (proportion, measurement) while teaching art history. If your child enjoys architecture, consider building a simple column from cardboard tubes and clay to see the three-dimensional form. The Parthenon's optical refinements (curved lines that appear straight, tapered columns that appear parallel) are a fascinating intersection of art, math, and visual perception.",
