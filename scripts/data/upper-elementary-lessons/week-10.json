An \"independent clause\" is like a full sentence that can stand all by itself – it makes sense on its own. A \"dependent clause\" is like a sentence that's missing something; it starts with a special word and needs another clause to make complete sense."

    "instructions": "1. Present a problem: 1/3 + 1/4. Use fraction strips to show these pieces do not align.\n2. Explain: you cannot add fractions with different denominators directly — the pieces are different sizes.\n3. Introduce Least Common Denominator (LCD) as the smallest common multiple of the denominators.\n4. Show the process: find LCD, convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with that LCD, then add.\n5. Model: 1/3 + 1/4 → 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12.\n6. Practice finding LCDs.\n7.

Explain the types: white bread (for nobles), dark bread (for commoners), trenchers (bread plates).\n3. Introduce the recipe: a simple hearth bread similar to medieval flatbread.\n4. Review kitchen safety and hygiene.\n5. Measure and mix ingredients.\n6. Knead the dough (discuss the science: gluten development).\n7. Let rise and bake.\n8.

Imagine eating bread for almost *every* meal, every single day – that's what people did!
