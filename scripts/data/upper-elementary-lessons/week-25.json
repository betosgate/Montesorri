          "mascot_explanation": "So, sales tax is like an extra fee the government adds to things you buy, and it's usually a small percentage of the price. This slide shows us exactly how to figure that out: you take the price of the item, change the tax percentage into a decimal (like 8% becomes 0.08), and multiply them together to find out how much the tax is.

          "mascot_explanation": "Now we're talking about tipping at restaurants, which is how we show appreciation for good service. This slide explains that 15% is a common tip, but 18% or 20% are even better for great service. It also gives us a cool trick for figuring out tips fast using mental math: find 10% by moving the decimal in the bill amount one spot to the left, then you can easily adjust that to get 15% or 20%.",

          "mascot_explanation": "This slide is all about discounts, which is when stores lower the price of something to get you to buy it. It works the opposite of tax; instead of adding money, you're taking it away.

          "mascot_explanation": "This is where things get a little trickier, but totally doable! It shows how to handle a situation where something is on sale *and* you have to pay tax on it.

Think of the \"rule of thirds\" like dividing your picture into nine boxes and putting the interesting stuff where the lines cross. \"Leading lines\" are like arrows in the photo that point your eyes to what's important.
