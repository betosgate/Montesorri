    "instructions": "1. Review simple and compound sentences from previous weeks.\n2. Introduce complex sentences: an independent clause joined with a dependent clause.\n3. Define subordinating conjunctions: because, although, when, if, since, while, after, before.\n4. Model how subordinating conjunctions show relationships: cause, contrast, time, condition.\n5. Practice identifying independent and dependent clauses in sample sentences.\n6. Demonstrate placing the dependent clause at the beginning vs. end of a sentence.\n7. Discuss comma rules: comma after a leading dependent clause, no comma when it follows.\n8. Students combine simple sentences into complex sentences using various conjunctions.\n9. Apply complex sentences to a paragraph about ancient Greece.\n10. Peer review for correct clause structure and punctuation.",
