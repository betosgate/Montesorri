    "description": "Students advance their grammar skills by learning to construct complex sentences using subordinating conjunctions. They explore how dependent and independent clauses work together to express nuanced relationships between ideas.",
    "instructions": "1. Review simple and compound sentences from previous weeks.\n2. Introduce complex sentences: an independent clause joined with a dependent clause.\n3. Define subordinating conjunctions: because, although, when, if, since, while, after, before.\n4. Model how subordinating conjunctions show relationships: cause, contrast, time, condition.\n5. Practice identifying independent and dependent clauses in sample sentences.\n6. Demonstrate placing the dependent clause at the beginning vs. end of a sentence.\n7. Discuss comma rules: comma after a leading dependent clause, no comma when it follows.\n8. Students combine simple sentences into complex sentences using various conjunctions.\n9. Apply complex sentences to a paragraph about ancient Greece.\n10. Peer review for correct clause structure and punctuation.",

A COMPLEX sentence joins an independent clause with a dependent clause: 'Although Sparta was strong, Athens led in philosophy and art.'",
          "mascot_explanation": "So, this step is showing us the difference between sentence types. A simple sentence is just one main idea, like \"The dog barked.\" A compound sentence connects two main ideas with words like \"and\" or \"but,\" like \"The dog barked, and the cat ran away.\" A complex sentence adds a smaller idea to a main idea using a special connector word, like \"The dog barked *because* he was hungry.\"",

          "mascot_explanation": "These special words we're using are called subordinating conjunctions, and they're like little traffic cops for our ideas. They tell us how two parts of a sentence relate to each other. For example, \"because\" or \"since\" show us a *cause*, like \"I was tired *because* I stayed up late.\" \"Although\" or \"while\" show us a *contrast*, and \"when,\" \"after,\" or \"before\" tell us about *time*.",

Trailing: 'Athens produced great philosophers because it valued education.' The independent clause gets emphasis. Both are correct; choose based on what you want to stress.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This is a neat trick about where you put the extra idea in your sentence. If you put the \"because\" part first, like \"Because it was raining, we stayed inside,\" it sets up the reason before telling you what happened. If you put it at the end, \"We stayed inside because it was raining,\" the main idea gets more attention. Both are right, it just changes what you want to emphasize!",

When the independent clause comes first, no comma is needed. 'Athens had a stronger navy although Sparta had a stronger army.'",
          "mascot_explanation": "Here's a super important punctuation rule: if you start your sentence with that extra idea (the dependent clause), you need to put a comma after it before you get to the main idea.

Because Greece is so hilly and has lots of islands, it broke up into smaller, separate towns.

          "mascot_explanation": "This slide explains how far away a place is from the equator, called latitude, really changes its climate. Places super close to the equator get the sun's rays straight on, making them hot all year, like the tropics. Places near the top and bottom of the Earth get the sun at a slant, so it's much colder there, which is why we have polar climates.

          "mascot_explanation": "This step is like stepping back in time to see where it all began. Imagine huge parties celebrating Dionysus, the god of fun and wine, and during these parties, people started singing and dancing together, telling stories.

          "text": "The Greek amphitheater was an engineering marvel. Cut into hillsides, it could seat 15,000 people. The curved shape amplified sound so well that a whisper on stage could be heard in the back row. The orchestra (circular area) held the chorus; the skene (building) was the backdrop and changing room.",
          "mascot_explanation": "Now we get to check out what an actual Greek theater looked like – pretty awesome, right? They were built right into hillsides so tons of people could watch, and the shape was super clever; it made the actors' voices carry all the way to the back! The big open circle on the ground was where the chorus hung out, and the building behind it was like the stage and a place for actors to get ready.",

Music was integral — plays were more like modern musicals than spoken dramas. Greek instruments included the lyre, aulos (double flute), and drums.",
          "mascot_explanation": "So, the \"chorus\" was a really important group of performers in Greek plays. They weren't just background singers; they were like the narrators, singing and dancing to tell us what was happening and how people felt.

Then plan the central design: a geometric pattern, a Greek key border, a simple image, or an abstract design. Choose your color scheme: 3-5 colors work best.",
          "mascot_explanation": "Now we're getting to the fun part: planning our own masterpiece! This slide tells us to use the graph paper to draw our design, where each square on the paper will be one of our little tiles. It's a good idea to start with a cool border pattern, then think about what you want in the middle, and pick about 3 to 5 colors that will look awesome together.",

First, use your graph paper and colored pencils to draw your mosaic design, making sure it's at least 8 by 8 squares and has a border and a cool center. Then, cut out or grab your small paper squares (your tesserae!) and start gluing them onto your cardboard base, following your design and leaving tiny spaces between them for the \"grout.\" Finally, think about what Greek art ideas and math concepts you used and be ready to share!",

It reminds us that even though mosaics are made of small pieces, when you put them together carefully, you can create something beautiful and amazing, just like the ancient Greeks did.

If your child enjoys this, explore real mosaic kits available at craft stores — working with actual tiles is a wonderful next step. Visit a museum or search online for Greek mosaics to see the incredible detail achievable with tiny tiles.",
