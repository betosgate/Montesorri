    "instructions": "1. Gather evidence of growth: reading logs, vocabulary notebooks, writing samples from September to now.\n2. Count total books read and pages consumed over the year.\n3. Analyze reading growth: What genres did you explore? How did your reading level change? What was your favorite book and why?\n4. Analyze writing growth: Compare an early writing sample with a recent one. What specific improvements can you identify?\n5. Review vocabulary growth: How many new words did you learn? Which ones do you use regularly now?\n6. Identify your three biggest literacy accomplishments this year.\n7. Identify one area where you still want to grow.\n8. Write a reflective essay (3-4 paragraphs): 'My Year as a Reader and Writer.'\n9. Create a visual timeline of your literacy milestones.\n10. Set three literacy goals for next year.",

If you want to make more cookies, say 30, you need to figure out how much flour. A proportion helps us do that: 2 cups for 12 cookies is the same ratio as *x* cups for 30 cookies, so we write it as 2/12 = x/30. Then, we use a cool trick called cross-multiplication to solve for *x*, which tells us we need 5 cups of flour."

    "instructions": "1. Discuss how real-world math rarely comes in neat categories — it requires combining skills.\n2. Present Scenario 1: Planning a road trip (distance, fuel costs, budgeting, time calculations).\n3. Present Scenario 2: Redesigning a room (area, perimeter, scale drawing, cost estimation).\n4. Present Scenario 3: Analyzing sports statistics (averages, percentages, probability of outcomes).\n5. Present Scenario 4: Starting a small business (pricing, profit margins, break-even point).\n6. Students choose two scenarios and solve them completely.\n7. For each scenario, list every math skill used.\n8. Discuss how math connects to career paths: engineering, medicine, business, science, technology.\n9. Students create one original real-world math scenario.\n10.

It's telling you that even though middle school feels like a huge leap, you've actually been building all the skills you need for it already.

It's letting you know that you'll meet lots of new people with different ideas and backgrounds, and the best way to navigate that is to just be yourself and be kind.
