Dr. King's speech uses the same persuasive techniques students studied earlier: ethos, pathos, logos, repetition, and metaphor.

The 'I Have a Dream' writing activity encourages children to connect civil rights ideals to issues they personally care about, making history relevant and personal. This is also a good opportunity to discuss how change happens through organized, persistent effort.",
