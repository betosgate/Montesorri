          "mascot_explanation": "Now we’re adding sales tax to that sale price. If the jacket is $30 after the discount, and the tax is 8%, we calculate 8% of $30 to find out how much extra we pay, and then add that to the $30.

Imagine you're on a bus and you have to move to the very back just because of how you look, and even give up your seat to someone else – that’s what Black passengers had to do in Montgomery back then. Rosa Parks’ refusal to give up her seat on December 1st was a huge moment, but the slide reminds us that she wasn't the only one who wanted change; people had been planning for this.",

So, imagine snow melting on a high mountain; that water flows down into rivers, which then might lead to wetlands, and finally out to the ocean.

          "mascot_explanation": "Alright, let's talk about some of the \"figurative language\" tricks poets use. A simile is like saying two things are similar using \"like\" or \"as\" – for example, \"brave as a lion.\" A metaphor is a bit bolder; it just says one thing *is* another thing, like \"the classroom was a zoo.\" Personification is when a poet makes something that isn't alive act like a person, like \"the wind whispered secrets.\" And hyperbole is just a super big exaggeration, like saying \"I'm so hungry I could eat a horse!\"",

Alliteration is when words close together start with the same consonant sound, like that tongue twister \"Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.\" Assonance is when vowel sounds repeat, like the 'a' sound in \"the rain in Spain stays mainly on the plain.\" Onomatopoeia is the fun one – it's words that sound like the noise they make, like \"buzz,\" \"hiss,\" or \"boom!\"",
