Gather all creative writing from the year: stories, poems, essays, journal entries.\n3. Reread each piece, noting emotional response and craft quality.\n4. Develop selection criteria: Which pieces show your strongest writing? Which ones are most meaningful to you? Which demonstrate growth?\n5. Select 5-8 pieces for the anthology.\n6. Arrange selected pieces in a deliberate order (chronological, thematic, or by genre).\n7. Identify which pieces need revision and what kind of revision each needs.\n8. Write a brief author's note for one selected piece explaining its significance.\n9. Design a preliminary table of contents.\n10. Set revision goals for the next writing sessions.",

          "mascot_explanation": "This step is super important because it explains *why* different places make different things. Think about it: places near the equator are hot and perfect for growing things like bananas, while places with lots of coal and iron are great for making steel.

          "mascot_explanation": "This is a really interesting point: just because a country has a lot of natural resources, like oil or diamonds, doesn't mean everyone in that country is rich. Sometimes, that wealth gets concentrated in just a few hands, which is called the \"resource curse.\" So, while geography can offer opportunities, how a country is run matters a lot for how people benefit."

You'll need some ads, like from magazines or online, so we can poke them apart.

But once we know the tricks they use, like how they try to make you feel a certain way, their ads won't be able to trick us anymore, and we'll be in charge of our money."

          "mascot_explanation": "Here we're going to learn some specific advertising tricks. Watch out for ads that try to make you feel happy or sad (that's emotional appeal), ads that say \"everyone's doing it!\" (that's the bandwagon effect), or when a famous person tells you to buy something (celebrity endorsement). They might also try to make you feel like you'll miss out if you don't buy something fast."

          "mascot_explanation": "This is a super important trick for saving money: checking the *unit price*. It means figuring out how much you're paying for *each* ounce or *each* item, not just the total price. Sometimes the bigger box looks like a better deal, but if you do the math, the smaller one might actually be cheaper per ounce, like in the example on the slide."

Watch out for reviews that sound *too* excited, are super short, or all seem to show up at the same time. The best reviews are the ones that talk about both good and bad things, so you get the real story."

You'll look at three ads and figure out the tricks they're using, then compare three different versions of the same product – maybe cereal or headphones – by checking their unit prices and reading those reviews we talked about.

Discuss how your family makes purchasing decisions without making it feel like finances are stressful. The goal is empowerment, not anxiety.",
