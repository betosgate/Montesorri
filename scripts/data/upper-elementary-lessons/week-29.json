    "description": "Students launch their multi-week research capstone project by selecting a topic that connects at least two subject areas studied this year. They craft a strong thesis statement and outline their research plan.",
    "instructions": "1. Review the purpose of a capstone project: synthesizing a year of learning into one deep research piece.\n2. Brainstorm possible topics that bridge two or more subject areas (e.g., how the digestive system was understood differently in ancient vs. modern times).\n3. Evaluate topics using criteria: personal interest, available sources, and connection to prior learning.\n4. Select a final topic and write a one-sentence thesis statement.\n5. Identify at least five potential sources (books, articles, reputable websites).\n6. Create a research timeline with milestones for the next four weeks.\n7. Draft an outline with introduction, three body sections, and conclusion.\n8. Peer-share thesis statements and receive feedback.\n9. Revise thesis statement based on feedback.\n10.

This slide introduces the trickier kind of equation, where 'x' isn't just on one side, but on both sides, like in `3x + 5 = x + 13`. It looks a little weird, but the main idea is still to get 'x' alone. The first big step is to move all the 'x' terms so they're all on the same side of the equals sign.",

          "mascot_explanation": "This is where we actually do the moving! To get all the 'x' terms together, we need to do the opposite of whatever operation is happening. Since we have 'x' on both sides, we'll subtract 'x' from *both* sides to keep the equation balanced, just like taking the same weight off each side of a scale. After that, it's just like the warm-up problems: get the constants away from 'x' and then divide to find 'x'.",

          "mascot_explanation": "This is a super important step, like double-checking your work before you hand it in. We take the answer we found for 'x' (which was 4 in the example) and plug it back into the *original* equation. If both sides of the equation still equal each other after we plug in the number, then we know we got it right! It's the best way to be sure.",

          "mascot_explanation": "Okay, so this slide is like our toolbox for today. You'll need the essay you wrote before, which is like the raw material we're going to work with. The transition word bank is a cheat sheet full of words that connect ideas, and the highlighters are like magic markers to help us see what's working and what's not.

          "mascot_explanation": "This step is super important because it tells us the difference between just fixing mistakes and actually making your writing better. Editing is like cleaning up a messy room, but revision is like rearranging the furniture to make it look way cooler and easier to move around in. Professional writers spend a lot of time revising, because that's how they turn good ideas into amazing stories or arguments.",

          "mascot_explanation": "So, grab your first highlighter – let's say it's yellow. Your job here is to find the main idea sentence, called the topic sentence, at the start of each paragraph. Think of it as the headline of that paragraph; it tells you exactly what it's going to be about. Make sure each one clearly tells you the main point and also connects back to your essay's big overall idea, your thesis.",

          "mascot_explanation": "Now, switch to your second highlighter, maybe blue. This time, you're looking for those \"bridge\" words and phrases that connect one idea to the next, like \"also,\" \"but,\" or \"so.\" These are called transitions, and they help your reader move smoothly from one thought to another. If you notice any paragraphs that feel like they just stop without a good connection, make a note of that gap.",

          "mascot_explanation": "Here's where you get to be a word wizard! Look at your transition word bank – it's organized by what the transition does, like adding an idea or showing a difference. Instead of just using \"and\" all the time, you can pick a more specific word from the bank, like \"furthermore\" if you're adding more info, or \"however\" if you're showing a contrast. This makes your writing sound much smarter and clearer.",

Frame it positively — revision is what professional writers do, and it is a sign of maturity as a writer. Do not combine revision and editing in the same session; they use different thinking skills. If your child resists changing their work, start small: revise just one paragraph together. Reading aloud is a powerful revision tool because the ear catches awkwardness that the eye misses.",

Calculate all three measures for the same data set and compare results.\n6. Discuss when each measure is most useful (mean for general average, median when there are outliers, mode for categorical data).\n7. Introduce the concept of outliers and how they affect the mean but not the median.\n8. Students calculate mean, median, and mode for five different data sets.\n9.

          "mascot_explanation": "Here's the \"mode,\" which is simply the number that shows up the most often, like the most popular flavor of ice cream at a party.

You're going to fill out a table showing how $100 grows over 10 years with compound interest, and then you'll draw two lines on a graph: one for simple interest and one for compound interest.

We're going to become literary detectives, looking closely at two different stories or poems to figure out what big message, or \"theme,\" they're both trying to tell us, even though they might tell it in different ways.

Then there's a Venn diagram, which is that cool chart with overlapping circles where we'll jot down how each story shows bravery and what they have in common.

          "mascot_explanation": "So, what's a theme? Think of it as the author's main point, the big takeaway message from the story, like \"honesty is the best policy\" or \"friendship is super important.\" Today, we're going to be super smart and look at two different stories that talk about the *same* big idea, but maybe show it through different characters or events.

The \"point-by-point\" method is like bouncing back and forth, talking about one aspect of the theme in both stories, then moving to the next aspect. The \"block\" method is where you talk all about the first story's theme, then all about the second story's theme. Pick the one that feels easier for you to explain your ideas.",

Make sure you're not just saying what the theme is, but you're proving it by using actual sentences or phrases you found in the stories, called evidence.

          "mascot_explanation": "So, the \"range\" is just a way to see how spread out your numbers are. To find it, you just take the biggest number in your list and subtract the smallest number. If you have {3, 7, 12, 15, 23}, the biggest is 23 and the smallest is 3, so the range is 23 minus 3, which equals 20.

          "mascot_explanation": "Now, imagine two basketball players who both average 20 points per game. Player A scores pretty close to 20 every time, like {18, 20, 22, 19, 21}, so their scores are really consistent. Player B, however, has scores like {5, 35, 10, 30, 20} – they sometimes score really low and sometimes really high!

Companies need to know if their products are consistent – you don't want a car door that sometimes fits perfectly and sometimes doesn't! Doctors need to know how consistent a medicine's effects are, and weathermen look at temperature ranges to see if it's going to be a steady warm day or jump all over.

Try this experiment: lay a flat paper towel on the tray of water and time how fast it absorbs. Now crumple another towel and place it in water — the crumpled towel absorbs faster because it has more surface area touching the water. Villi work the same way.",
          "mascot_explanation": "Imagine the inside of your small intestine is lined with millions of tiny, fuzzy fingers called villi – they look like little hairs. These villi are amazing because they increase the surface area, like how a crumpled towel soaks up water way faster than a flat one. This means your body can grab way more nutrients from your food.",

Your small intestine absorbs about 90% of all nutrients from food.",
          "mascot_explanation": "Through those fuzzy villi walls, all the good stuff from your food, like sugars (glucose), building blocks (amino acids), and fats, gets squeezed into your blood.

The best way to find mistakes is to read your writing out loud – it helps you hear when something sounds a bit off.
