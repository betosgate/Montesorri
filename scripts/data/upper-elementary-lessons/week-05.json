It challenges the assumption that oral cultures were 'primitive' — in fact, they developed extraordinarily sophisticated memory systems. The griot tradition, Aboriginal songlines, and Polynesian navigation chants represent cognitive achievements comparable to any technology. The retelling activity is powerful: children often discover they are better at remembering and telling stories than they expected. For the folktale, you might choose an Anansi story (West African), a pourquoi tale (why stories), or a myth your family connects with culturally. The act of performing for an audience — making eye contact, using gestures, varying tone — builds confidence and communication skills that extend far beyond this lesson.",

    "parent_notes": "Making connections (text-to-self, text-to-text, text-to-world) is a key reading comprehension strategy that good readers do automatically. Modeling this for your child is powerful: as you read aloud, pause and share your own connections ('This reminds me of...' or 'This connects to what we learned about...'). The close reading option is excellent for developing analytical skills — choosing a single paragraph and examining the author's craft teaches students to read like writers. The mentor reflection is personally meaningful and helps children articulate gratitude and awareness of influential relationships in their lives. Adjust reading pace to your child's interest — if they are deeply engaged, read more; if attention is waning, read less and discuss more.",
