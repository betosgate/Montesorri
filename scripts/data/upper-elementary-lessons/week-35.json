Review formal letter format: date, greeting, body, closing, signature.\n4. Model writing a specific, heartfelt thank you letter — not generic but detailed.\n5. Discuss the difference between 'Thank you for helping me' and 'Thank you for staying after school to explain fractions when I was frustrated — that patience changed my whole year.'\n6. Students write at least three thank you letters to different people.\n7. Each letter should include: a specific act of support, the impact it had, and genuine appreciation.\n8. Address envelopes properly.\n9. Create a hand-decorated card for one special recipient.\n10. Mail or deliver the letters.",

          "mascot_explanation": "This step explains why taking the time to write a real letter is so cool. In a world where we send quick texts, a letter shows someone you really cared enough to pause and put your thoughts down on paper.

Instead of just saying \"thanks for helping,\" you want to mention exactly *what* they did, like \"thanks for explaining that tricky math problem.\" It's like giving them a specific compliment that shows you really remember their kindness.",

Second, explain how that action made you feel or what it helped you achieve.

Actually mailing the letters (rather than just writing them) completes the lesson and creates real-world impact. If a thank you letter is directed to you, receiving it will be one of the most moving moments of your parenting year. Consider making year-end thank you letters a family tradition.",

Map the local area: identify geographic features within walking, biking, and driving distance.\n3. List potential summer exploration destinations: parks, rivers, mountains, historic sites, museums.\n4. Create a 'Geographic Scavenger Hunt' for the local area.\n5. Plan one major geographic excursion and several smaller local explorations.\n6. Discuss geographic skills to practice: map reading, compass use, distance estimation, observation.\n7. Create a summer exploration journal template.\n8. Set geographic exploration goals for the summer.\n9. Discuss safe exploration practices.\n10. Share excitement about summer geographic adventures.",

          "mascot_explanation": "This step is basically saying that we're super lucky because we live in a time when science is making HUGE leaps.

Remember seeing pictures of black holes or hearing about gravitational waves? Those were huge, impossible-seeming discoveries! What seems super futuristic now might be totally normal for you when you grow up.",
