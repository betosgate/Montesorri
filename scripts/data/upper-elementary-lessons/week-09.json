The flood story comparison (Gilgamesh vs. Noah) often sparks deep thinking about cultural transmission and shared human experience.

The original myth writing activity is creative and fun. If your child gets excited about mythology, this is a perfect lead-in to Q2, where Greek myths will feature prominently.
