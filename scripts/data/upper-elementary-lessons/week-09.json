Well, genes are specific parts of that manual that tell us things like what color our eyes should be or if we're tall or short. This slide reminds us that some traits are \"dominant\" and show up even if you only have one copy, while \"recessive\" traits only show up if you have two copies.

Flatbread is the simplest recipe and connects to both civilizations. If you have dates and honey, the date balls are delicious and no-cook. The 'toast' activity practices public speaking in a low-stakes, celebratory context. Take photos of the whole event — the table, the food, the decorations, the display of work. This is what Montessori education looks like at its best: joyful, integrated, and connected to the real world.",

    "parent_notes": "Mythology is endlessly fascinating for this age group. The flood story comparison (Gilgamesh vs. Noah) often sparks deep thinking about cultural transmission and shared human experience. Handle the comparison sensitively if your family has religious connections to these stories — frame it as 'stories that traveled and were told in different ways by different cultures.' The original myth writing activity is creative and fun. If your child gets excited about mythology, this is a perfect lead-in to Q2, where Greek myths will feature prominently. Recommended books: D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths (preview for Q2), Tales of Ancient Egypt by Roger Lancelyn Green.",
