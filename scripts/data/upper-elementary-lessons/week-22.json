Explain the basic debate structure: opening statement, arguments, rebuttals, closing statement.\n3. Introduce the CER framework: Claim (your position), Evidence (facts that support it), Reasoning (why the evidence matters).\n4. Model building a CER argument on a simple topic: 'Schools should have longer recess.'\n5. Discuss types of evidence: statistics, expert opinions, examples, analogies.\n6. Practice distinguishing strong evidence from weak evidence.\n7. Introduce logical fallacies to watch for: ad hominem, false dichotomy, appeal to emotion without evidence.\n8. Students practice building CER arguments on assigned topics.\n9. Share arguments and evaluate evidence strength.\n10. Discuss: Why is the ability to argue logically important in a democracy?",

The real-world applications are key motivators — help your child see that algebra solves practical problems. At home, create scenarios: 'If we save $25 per week and already have $50, how many weeks until we have $200?' (25w + 50 = 200). If your child struggles, return to the balance scale model and work through each step physically. The 'unwrapping a present' metaphor helps remember the order: outer layer (addition/subtraction) first, then inner layer (multiplication/division).",

If your child wants to build a more elaborate machine at home, encourage it with household materials. YouTube has many inspiring Rube Goldberg machine videos that can spark ideas. The key learning is that every machine, no matter how simple or complex, operates through energy transformations.",

They study examples from Picasso's Guernica to modern street art, then create their own socially conscious artwork addressing an issue they care about.",
    "instructions": "1. Discuss how art can be a powerful tool for social commentary and change.\n2. Examine Picasso's 'Guernica' — created in response to the bombing of a Spanish town during the Spanish Civil War.\n3. Study Diego Rivera's murals depicting the lives of workers and indigenous people.\n4. View examples of modern social commentary art: street art, protest posters, political cartoons.\n5. Discuss: What makes socially conscious art effective?\n6. Connect to the community service project: how can art raise awareness?\n7. Brainstorm social issues students care about.\n8. Students plan and create a piece of socially conscious artwork.\n9. Write artist statements explaining their work's message and purpose.\n10. Gallery walk with artist statements — discuss the power of art as activism.",
