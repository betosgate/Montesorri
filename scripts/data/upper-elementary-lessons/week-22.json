    "description": "Students learn the foundational structure of formal debate, including claim, evidence, and reasoning. They examine how effective debaters construct arguments and practice distinguishing between strong and weak evidence to support a position.",
    "instructions": "1. Define debate as a structured discussion where two sides present arguments on a topic.\n2. Explain the basic debate structure: opening statement, arguments, rebuttals, closing statement.\n3. Introduce the CER framework: Claim (your position), Evidence (facts that support it), Reasoning (why the evidence matters).\n4. Model building a CER argument on a simple topic: 'Schools should have longer recess.'\n5. Discuss types of evidence: statistics, expert opinions, examples, analogies.\n6. Practice distinguishing strong evidence from weak evidence.\n7. Introduce logical fallacies to watch for: ad hominem, false dichotomy, appeal to emotion without evidence.\n8. Students practice building CER arguments on assigned topics.\n9. Share arguments and evaluate evidence strength.\n10. Discuss: Why is the ability to argue logically important in a democracy?",

          "text": "A DEBATE is not an argument or a fight — it is a structured, respectful exchange of ideas where both sides present evidence to support their position. Debating teaches you to think critically, communicate clearly, and consider perspectives different from your own. These skills are essential in school, careers, and civic life.",
          "mascot_explanation": "So, this step is explaining what a debate really is. It's not just yelling at each other; it's a respectful way to talk about different ideas, where each side tries to convince the other using facts. Learning this helps you think better and explain your ideas clearly, which is useful for pretty much everything you'll do.",

EVIDENCE — specific facts, data, or examples that support your claim ('Studies show students who have longer recess score 15% higher on afternoon tests'). REASONING — explains WHY the evidence supports the claim ('This shows that physical activity improves focus and academic performance').",
          "mascot_explanation": "This is the heart of building an argument – the CER framework! CER stands for Claim, Evidence, and Reasoning. Your Claim is what you believe, the Evidence is the proof you have, and the Reasoning is explaining *why* that proof makes your claim true. It's like saying \"I want pizza\" (Claim), \"because it's delicious and I'm hungry\" (Evidence/Reasoning).",

WEAK evidence includes: personal anecdotes presented as proof, unverified claims, emotional appeals without facts, and opinions stated as facts. A good debater uses the strongest available evidence.",
          "mascot_explanation": "Now we're talking about the *kind* of proof you use. Strong evidence is like solid facts, numbers from real studies, or what experts say, while weak evidence is more like just saying \"I feel this way\" or repeating something you heard without checking if it's true. Using strong evidence makes your argument way more believable.",

FALSE DICHOTOMY: presenting only two options when more exist. APPEAL TO EMOTION: using feelings instead of facts. BANDWAGON: 'Everyone thinks so, so it must be true.' Recognizing fallacies makes you a stronger thinker and debater.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This slide warns us about \"logical fallacies,\" which are like sneaky tricks in arguments that sound good but aren't actually logical. For example, attacking the person instead of their idea, or saying something is true just because lots of people believe it. Knowing these helps you spot them and avoid using them yourself.",

When people are desperate, hungry, and angry, they become vulnerable to leaders who promise simple solutions and someone to blame.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This step is super important because it sets the scene for why dictators even came about. After World War I, Germany was treated really harshly, which made people angry and embarrassed. Then, the Great Depression hit, making everyone super poor and unemployed, which just made things worse.

          "mascot_explanation": "Here we learn about Adolf Hitler in Germany. He and his Nazi Party were really good at blaming other people, especially Jewish people and the government, for all of Germany's problems. Hitler promised to make Germany strong and respected again, using exciting rallies and controlling what people saw and heard to get them on his side.

(5) SUPPRESSION OF OPPOSITION — silencing critics, banning other political parties, controlling the press.",

Anything moving has kinetic energy — a thrown ball, a flowing river, even the air molecules in a breeze. The faster something moves and the more massive it is, the more kinetic energy it has.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This step is all about kinetic energy, which is basically the energy of anything that's moving. Think about when you're running really fast, or a car speeding down the road – they've got kinetic energy because they're in motion! The faster something moves and the heavier it is, the more kinetic energy it has.",

ELASTIC potential energy is stored in stretched or compressed objects: a pulled-back rubber band, a compressed spring. CHEMICAL potential energy is stored in the bonds of molecules: food, batteries, fuel.",
          "mascot_explanation": "Now we're talking about potential energy, which is like stored-up energy just waiting to be used. There are a few kinds: gravitational is when something is high up, like a ball held way above the ground. Elastic is when something is stretched, like a rubber band pulled back, and chemical energy is stored in things like food or batteries.",

At the bottom, it has maximum kinetic energy. As it bounces back up, kinetic converts back to potential. A pendulum swings back and forth, endlessly converting between potential and kinetic.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This slide shows how energy likes to change from one type to another, which is called transformation. Imagine holding a ball up high – that's potential energy. When you let it go, it starts falling, and that potential energy turns into kinetic energy as it speeds up. When it bounces, it goes back and forth between kinetic and potential energy.",

          "mascot_explanation": "This is a super important idea called the Law of Conservation of Energy. It means energy can't just disappear, it only changes its form.

We'll do three: first, roll balls down ramps from different heights to see how height (potential energy) affects how far they roll (kinetic energy). Then, we'll stretch rubber bands different amounts to see how that changes how far they launch things.

In real life, you see objects from many angles — front, side, top, back. CUBISM attempts to show ALL these viewpoints at the SAME TIME in a single image. The result looks fractured and geometric, like looking through a shattered mirror.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This step explains the big idea behind Cubism: why stick to just one view when you can show everything? Artists like Picasso and Braque realized that in real life, we see things from all sides, so they decided to paint that way too, breaking things up into geometric pieces to show the front, side, and top all at once. It's like looking at a face through a kaleidoscope, where you see all the parts but they're rearranged.",

This is not a mistake — it is a deliberate attempt to show MORE INFORMATION than a traditional portrait can. Cubism sacrifices realistic appearance for a deeper kind of truth.",
          "mascot_explanation": "Now we're looking at how Cubist artists actually put those different views together in a painting, especially for portraits. Imagine drawing a face where one eye is looking straight at you, but the other eye is looking to the side, and the nose is sticking out sideways – it sounds weird, but it's how they showed you more of the person. They're not trying to make it look exactly like a photo, but more like how we really experience seeing something from every angle.",

SYNTHETIC CUBISM (1912-1920s) added color, texture, and collage elements — pasting newspaper, fabric, and other materials onto the canvas. Both approaches challenged the idea that art must imitate reality.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This slide breaks down the two main types of Cubism: Analytical and Synthetic. Analytical Cubism, the earlier style, used lots of muted colors like browns and grays and broke things into tiny geometric shapes, almost like looking through a shattered piece of glass. Synthetic Cubism came later and was more colorful, and artists even started adding things like newspaper clippings or fabric to their paintings, making them feel more like a collage.",

Instead of shopping at the store run by people who threaten their community, they arrange for families to shop in Vicksburg, even though it is farther away. This is ECONOMIC RESISTANCE — using the power of money to fight injustice.",
          "mascot_explanation": "So, in these chapters, we'll see the Logan family doing something really brave. They're deciding not to shop at the Wallace store anymore because the owners are being mean and unfair. Instead, they're going to travel all the way to Vicksburg to buy things. This is called an \"economic boycott\" – basically, using their money to say, \"We won't support you when you treat us badly.\"",

Taylor is showing us that economic independence and political resistance are deeply connected.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This next part is super important for understanding *why* the Logans can even *do* this boycott. Because they own their own land, nobody can kick them out if they cause trouble for the white store owners. This land gives them a safety net, a kind of freedom that families who rent land don't have, and they're using that security to help everyone stand up for themselves.",

Others cannot afford the extra cost or effort of shopping in Vicksburg. This is realistic: resistance always involves risk, and different people have different levels of risk they can bear.",
          "mascot_explanation": "Now, it's important to know that not everyone in the community is going to join this boycott, and the book shows us why. Some folks are too scared because they depend on the white landowners and worry about getting in trouble. Others might not have the extra money or time to travel to Vicksburg. It's a tough choice for everyone, and the book shows us that standing up for what's right isn't always easy.",

          "mascot_explanation": "This slide connects the story to real history, which is really cool! It reminds us of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, where Black people refused to ride the buses for over a year to protest unfair treatment.

(2) EXPRESSIONS combine variables with operations. (3) EQUATIONS set two expressions equal and can be SOLVED. (4) INEQUALITIES show relationships using greater than/less than and have RANGES of solutions.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This is like our quick recap of what algebra is all about. It's reminding us that variables are just placeholders for numbers we don't know yet, like when you're trying to figure out how many cookies are left. Expressions are just combinations of those variables and numbers, and equations are like a balanced scale where two expressions are equal, and we can figure out the unknown number. Inequalities are similar, but they show us a range of possible answers instead of just one.",

          "mascot_explanation": "Here's a quick guide on how to tackle different kinds of equations and inequalities. For the easy ones, you just do one opposite math step, like adding if you see subtraction. For slightly trickier ones, you undo the addition or subtraction first, then the multiplication or division. If you have letters on both sides, get them all together first, and for inequalities, solve them like equations but remember to draw a specific kind of circle on the number line depending on whether it's just \"greater than\" or \"greater than or equal to.\"",

(4) Mixing up open and closed circles on inequality graphs. (5) Writing the wrong inequality direction. ALWAYS check by substituting your answer back into the original.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This slide is super important because it points out the common traps people fall into when solving equations. The biggest one is forgetting to do the exact same thing to both sides of the equation, which throws off the balance.

We study this not to cause pain, but because REMEMBERING is how we work to prevent it from ever happening again.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This part explains what the Holocaust actually was. It was a terrible time when a group called the Nazis in Germany murdered millions of Jewish people, and also many other groups, on purpose.

Each stage was worse, and at each stage, people had the chance to resist — some did, most did not.",
          "mascot_explanation": "So, the Holocaust didn't just start with people being killed; it got worse step-by-step. First, Jewish people were treated unfairly with new laws, then they were forced to live in separate, crowded areas called ghettos, then they were rounded up and sent to camps, and finally, they were murdered in huge numbers.

Anne died in a concentration camp just weeks before liberation. Her words remind us of the humanity that persecution tried to destroy.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This slide introduces us to Anne Frank, a Jewish girl who hid from the Nazis for two years. She kept a diary, and even though she was living in hiding and in fear, she wrote about believing that people are good deep down.

Each step triggers the next, and at each transition, energy TRANSFORMS from one type to another. These machines are both fun engineering challenges AND perfect demonstrations of energy transformation principles.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This step explains what a Rube Goldberg machine actually is: it's a super long and silly way to do one small task, where each thing you do makes the next thing happen, like a domino effect. The really cool part is that at every single step, the energy changes from one type to another, which is what we're learning about.",

(5) Marble hits a cup balanced on a lever, which tips and pulls a string (kinetic to mechanical). Each transition is an energy transformation.",
          "mascot_explanation": "Here's an example of how energy changes in a Rube Goldberg machine: you might push a domino, which has kinetic energy (energy of motion), and when it falls, it pushes a marble. That marble sitting on top has potential energy (stored energy), but as it rolls down a ramp, that potential energy turns into kinetic energy. This shows us how energy can transform from one type to another.",

Your artwork today should address an issue you genuinely care about: environmental protection, equality, kindness, community, or any cause meaningful to you.",
