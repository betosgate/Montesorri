Have the student read their draft aloud to identify awkward phrasing, missing transitions, and unclear arguments.\n3. Work through the paper section by section: introduction with thesis, body paragraphs with evidence, and conclusion.\n4. Guide the student to strengthen topic sentences so each paragraph has a clear purpose.\n5. Check that every claim is supported by at least one cited source — model how to fix unsupported statements.\n6. Review the bibliography or works cited page for correct formatting.\n7. Have the student revise for grammar, spelling, and punctuation using a proofreading checklist.\n8. Create a clean final copy — typed or neatly handwritten.\n9. Design a title page with the project title, student name, and date.\n10. Celebrate the completion of a major academic milestone.",

We'll start with your introduction to make sure it grabs the reader's attention and clearly tells them what your whole paper is about – that's your thesis!

Read chapters 1-4 aloud (approximately 30 pages), pausing to discuss Auggie's perspective.\n3. After chapter 1, discuss: 'Auggie says he is ordinary inside. What does he mean by that?'\n4. Notice the first-person narration — how does hearing Auggie's own voice affect how we feel about him?\n5. Discuss the family dynamics: how do Auggie's parents and sister each respond to his situation?\n6. Explore the theme of 'precepts' that Mr. Browne introduces — what are precepts and why do they matter?\n7. Ask: 'Have you ever been the new person somewhere? How did it feel?'\n8. Connect to the Montessori value of respect for all people.\n9. Have the student write a response: 'What would you want Auggie to know if he were coming to your school?'\n10.

Review the research paper and identify 5-7 key points that form the backbone of the presentation.\n3. For each key point, design a visual aid: a slide, poster section, or prop that illustrates the point.\n4. Apply the '5x5 rule' for slides/posters: no more than 5 bullet points, no more than 5 words each.\n5. Include at least one graph, chart, image, or map in the visual aids.\n6. Create speaking note cards — brief prompts, NOT full sentences to read.\n7. Practice the presentation structure: introduction, main points, conclusion, questions.\n8. Rehearse with a timer — aim for 8-10 minutes.\n9. Practice eye contact, clear voice, and confident posture.\n10. Do a full rehearsal for a family member and incorporate their feedback.",

Discuss: 'Can you think of a time when you and someone else experienced the same event differently?'\n6. Notice R.J. Palacio's use of multiple narrators — why does the author choose to tell the story this way?\n7. Explore the theme of empathy: understanding requires seeing through another person's eyes.\n8.

The SMART framework prevents vague, unmeasurable goals that lead to frustration. During the reflection phase, celebrate accomplishments genuinely — children often undervalue their growth. For the goal-setting phase, ensure the goals come from your child, not from you. Parent-imposed goals lack intrinsic motivation. You can suggest areas to consider ('Have you thought about social goals?') without dictating specific goals. The visual tracker is motivating for many students. Plan to revisit these goals together during the summer to maintain momentum. File the goals somewhere accessible for September.",

We need your science notebooks, some big paper, markers, all the notes or papers from your science fair project, and some regular lined paper.

          "mascot_explanation": "This step is all about understanding that being a scientist isn't just about following a checklist; it's about how you *think*. You've already used this way of thinking in lots of different science areas this year, like when we studied the Earth, plants and animals, how things are made, how things move, and how nature works together. We're going to trace how you used those thinking steps throughout the year."

          "mascot_explanation": "Now, think about that science fair project you did – that was a perfect example of the whole scientific method in action! This slide wants you to go back and look at each part of your project: your observation, your question, your hypothesis, your experiment, and what you found out. Then, be honest with yourself: what part did you do super well, and what could you maybe do a little differently or better next time?"

          "mascot_explanation": "This is where we get creative and see how all the science you learned fits together like a giant puzzle. You're going to make a \"concept map\" on that big paper. Think about how studying rocks and weather (earth science) connects to how plants grow (biology) or how pollution affects nature (ecology), and try to draw lines and write notes showing those connections."

          "mascot_explanation": "So, this slide is reminding you that you don't have to be in a lab to think like a scientist! Remember when your video game glitched, and you tried different things to fix it? Or when you tried a new recipe and adjusted the ingredients? That's all scientific thinking – observing, guessing what might work, trying it out, and seeing what happens. We're going to brainstorm other times you've used these skills."

You'll create that awesome concept map we talked about, showing all the big science ideas from the whole year and how they link up. Then, you'll write a reflection, like a mini-story, about how you think like a scientist, using real examples from the science you did this year.

          "mascot_explanation": "Wow, look at everything you've accomplished! This last slide is a reminder that you *are* a scientist. You learned how to really look at things, ask smart questions, test your ideas, and learn from what happened, even if it wasn't what you expected. You can now explain the scientific method, connect different science ideas, think about your own experiments, and even see science thinking in everyday life. That's awesome!"

The concept map is a powerful tool for seeing connections — help your child start with a central concept and branch outward. The reflection essay ('How I Think Like a Scientist') is one of the most important pieces of writing this year; it articulates a way of thinking that will serve them forever. Encourage specific examples: 'When I could not figure out why my plants were dying, I made observations, formed a hypothesis, and tested it.' Middle school science becomes more specialized; celebrate that your child has a broad foundation across multiple domains. Save the concept map and reflection for the portfolio.",

    "description": "Students write a formal art criticism essay analyzing a famous artwork, applying the four steps of art criticism: description, analysis, interpretation, and judgment. This connects visual art appreciation to academic writing and demonstrates that art can be discussed with the same rigor as science or history.",
    "instructions": "1. Introduce the four steps of art criticism: Describe (what do you see?), Analyze (how is it organized?), Interpret (what does it mean?), Judge (is it successful?).\n2. Choose a famous artwork to analyze (e.g., Starry Night, The Great Wave, Guernica, or another work the student finds compelling).\n3. Step 1 — Description: List everything you can see without interpreting. Colors, shapes, figures, setting, medium.\n4. Step 2 — Analysis: How did the artist use line, color, shape, space, texture, and composition? What principles of design are evident?\n5. Step 3 — Interpretation: What is the artist trying to communicate? What emotions does the work evoke? What is the deeper meaning?\n6. Step 4 — Judgment: Is this a successful work of art? Why or why not? Use specific evidence from your analysis.\n7. Draft the essay with one paragraph for each step, plus an introduction and conclusion.\n8. Revise for clarity, evidence, and academic tone.\n9. Compare your interpretation with published interpretations of the same work.\n10. Discuss: Can art mean different things to different people? Is there a 'right' interpretation?",

The four-step framework provides structure that makes 'talking about art' accessible rather than intimidating. Let your child choose an artwork they find genuinely interesting — engagement matters more than choosing the 'right' masterpiece. During the description phase, challenge them to notice details they initially missed. The judgment step is where students learn to support opinions with evidence — a crucial academic skill. Comparing their interpretation with published ones shows that thoughtful analysis is valued, and that multiple valid interpretations can coexist. This essay belongs in both the writing anthology and the art portfolio.",
