Guide the student to strengthen topic sentences so each paragraph has a clear purpose.\n5. Check that every claim is supported by at least one cited source — model how to fix unsupported statements.\n6. Review the bibliography or works cited page for correct formatting.\n7. Have the student revise for grammar, spelling, and punctuation using a proofreading checklist.\n8. Create a clean final copy — typed or neatly handwritten.\n9. Design a title page with the project title, student name, and date.\n10. Celebrate the completion of a major academic milestone.",

    "parent_notes": "This review lesson is about building a scientific identity, not just reviewing content. The concept map is a powerful tool for seeing connections — help your child start with a central concept and branch outward. The reflection essay ('How I Think Like a Scientist') is one of the most important pieces of writing this year; it articulates a way of thinking that will serve them forever. Encourage specific examples: 'When I could not figure out why my plants were dying, I made observations, formed a hypothesis, and tested it.' Middle school science becomes more specialized; celebrate that your child has a broad foundation across multiple domains. Save the concept map and reflection for the portfolio.",

    "description": "Students write a formal art criticism essay analyzing a famous artwork, applying the four steps of art criticism: description, analysis, interpretation, and judgment. This connects visual art appreciation to academic writing and demonstrates that art can be discussed with the same rigor as science or history.",
    "instructions": "1. Introduce the four steps of art criticism: Describe (what do you see?), Analyze (how is it organized?), Interpret (what does it mean?), Judge (is it successful?).\n2. Choose a famous artwork to analyze (e.g., Starry Night, The Great Wave, Guernica, or another work the student finds compelling).\n3. Step 1 — Description: List everything you can see without interpreting. Colors, shapes, figures, setting, medium.\n4. Step 2 — Analysis: How did the artist use line, color, shape, space, texture, and composition? What principles of design are evident?\n5. Step 3 — Interpretation: What is the artist trying to communicate? What emotions does the work evoke? What is the deeper meaning?\n6. Step 4 — Judgment: Is this a successful work of art? Why or why not? Use specific evidence from your analysis.\n7. Draft the essay with one paragraph for each step, plus an introduction and conclusion.\n8. Revise for clarity, evidence, and academic tone.\n9. Compare your interpretation with published interpretations of the same work.\n10. Discuss: Can art mean different things to different people? Is there a 'right' interpretation?",

    "parent_notes": "Art criticism develops visual literacy, analytical thinking, and academic writing simultaneously. The four-step framework provides structure that makes 'talking about art' accessible rather than intimidating. Let your child choose an artwork they find genuinely interesting — engagement matters more than choosing the 'right' masterpiece. During the description phase, challenge them to notice details they initially missed. The judgment step is where students learn to support opinions with evidence — a crucial academic skill. Comparing their interpretation with published ones shows that thoughtful analysis is valued, and that multiple valid interpretations can coexist. This essay belongs in both the writing anthology and the art portfolio.",
