If you have 17 slices of pizza cut into fifths, and you want to know how many whole pizzas that makes, you'd divide 17 by 5. Five goes into 17 three whole times, with 2 slices left over.

Its capital, Constantinople (modern Istanbul, Turkey), was the richest, most magnificent city in the world for centuries.",
          "mascot_explanation": "This part is super important for understanding what happened. When people say \"Rome fell,\" they usually mean the Western Roman Empire, which totally collapsed.

          "mascot_explanation": "This step is all about understanding how decimals work with place value, just like we know how ones, tens, and hundreds work. Imagine the decimal point is a special marker; everything to its left is a whole number, and everything to its right shows fractions of a whole, but instead of cutting things into halves or thirds, we're usually cutting them into ten, one hundred, or one thousand equal pieces.

          "mascot_explanation": "Now we're going to use that 10x10 grid to actually *see* what tenths and hundredths look like. Think of the whole grid as one whole pizza. If you shade in one whole column, that's 10 squares out of 100, which is like 10/100 or 0.1 (one tenth). If you shade 5 individual squares, that's 5/100 or 0.05 (five hundredths).

          "mascot_explanation": "Time to make it bigger and a bit more challenging! You'll use a larger grid, like 5x5 or 6x6 dots, and draw a knot that's one single, continuous line. This means the line has to weave all the way through the whole design and end up back where it started without breaking. It's like a puzzle, but a really pretty one!",

Ensure all crossings alternate over-under correctly. Once you are happy with the design, go over it with black fine-tip marker, thickening the strands. Erase pencil marks. Add color — Celts used rich blues, reds, greens, and gold. Frame your knot in a circular, square, or cross shape.",

Start by sketching a design on graph paper using the grid method, making sure all your lines go over and under correctly. Once you're happy with it, trace over your pencil lines with the black marker, then erase the pencil. Finally, add some cool Celtic colors like deep blues, reds, or greens, and maybe even frame your knot in a circle or a cross shape.",

These ancient designs are still amazing today because they're beautiful and also super smart in how they're put together. The main thing to check is if your knot has those correct over-and-under crossings and if the line keeps going all the way around!",

    "parent_notes": "Celtic knotwork combines art, math (geometry, topology), and cultural history. The grid method makes complex-looking patterns achievable for children. Common challenges: maintaining the over-under alternation (if you lose track, color the strands differently to follow them) and keeping lines smooth and symmetrical. Celtic art connects to the illuminated manuscripts lesson from last week and the medieval history unit. If your child enjoys this, there are many online tutorials and books for progressively complex designs. This is excellent fine motor and spatial reasoning practice.",
